    title "secure nested codes for type ii wiretap channels"
    abstract "This paper considers the problem of secure coding design for a type II wiretap channel, where the main channel is noiseless and the eavesdropper channel is a general binary-input symmetric-output memoryless channel. The proposed secure error-correcting code has a nested code structure. Two secure nested coding schemes are studied for a type II Gaussian wiretap channel. The nesting is based on cosets of a good code sequence for the first scheme and on cosets of the dual of a good code sequence for the second scheme. In each case, the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the threshold behavior of good code sequences. The two secure coding schemes together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study. The proposed secure coding scheme is extended to a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel. A new achievable perfect secrecy rate, which improves upon the previously reported result by Thangaraj et al., is derived for this channel."

    title "efficient reconciliation protocol for discrete variable quantum key distribution"
    abstract "Reconciliation is an essential part of any secret-key agreement protocol and hence of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, where two legitimate parties are given correlated data and want to agree on a common string in the presence of an adversary, while revealing a minimum amount of information. In this paper, we show that for discrete-variable QKD protocols, this problem can be advantageously solved with Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes optimized for the binary symmetric channel (BSC). In particular, we demonstrate that our method leads to a significant improvement of the achievable secret key rate, with respect to earlier interactive reconciliation methods used in QKD."

    title "reconciliation of a quantum distributed gaussian key"
    abstract "Two parties, Alice and Bob, wish to distill a binary secret key out of a list of correlated variables that they share after running a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol based on continuous-spectrum quantum carriers. We present a novel construction that allows the legitimate parties to get equal bit strings out of correlated variables by using a classical channel, with as little leaked information as possible. This opens the way to securely correcting nonbinary key elements. In particular, the construction is refined to the case of Gaussian variables as it applies directly to recent continuous-variable protocols for QKD."

    title "separation of reliability and secrecy in rate limited secret key generation"
    abstract "For a discrete or a continuous source model, we study the problem of secret-key generation with one round of rate-limited public communication between two legitimate users. Although we do not provide new bounds on the wiretap secret-key (WSK) capacity for the discrete source model, we use an alternative achievability scheme that may be useful for practical applications. As a side result, we conveniently extend known bounds to the case of a continuous source model. Specifically, we consider a sequential key-generation strategy, that implements a rate-limited reconciliation step to handle reliability, followed by a privacy amplification step performed with extractors to handle secrecy. We prove that such a sequential strategy achieves the best known bounds for the rate-limited WSK capacity (under the assumption of degraded sources in the case of two-way communication). However, we show that, unlike the case of rate-unlimited public communication, achieving the reconciliation capacity in a sequential strategy does not necessarily lead to achieving the best known bounds for the WSK capacity. Consequently, reliability and secrecy can be treated successively but not independently, thereby exhibiting a limitation of sequential strategies for rate-limited public communication. Nevertheless, we provide scenarios for which reliability and secrecy can be treated successively and independently, such as the two-way rate-limited SK capacity, the one-way rate-limited WSK capacity for degraded binary symmetric sources, and the one-way rate-limited WSK capacity for Gaussian degraded sources."

    title "low power secret key agreement over ofdm"
    abstract "Information-theoretic secret-key agreement is perhaps the most practically feasible mechanism that provides unconditional security at the physical layer to date. In this paper, we consider the problem of secret-key agreement by sharing randomness at low power over an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) link, in the presence of an eavesdropper. The low power assumption greatly simplifies the design of the randomness sharing scheme, even in a fading channel scenario. We assess the performance of the proposed system in terms of secrecy key rate and show that a practical approach to key sharing is obtained by using low-density parity check (LDPC) codes for information reconciliation. Numerical results confirm the merits of the proposed approach as a feasible and practical solution. Moreover, the outage formulation allows to implement secret-key agreement even when only statistical knowledge of the eavesdropper channel is available."

    title "secret sharing ldpc codes for the bpsk constrained gaussian wiretap channel"
    abstract "The problem of secret sharing over the Gaussian wiretap channel is considered. A source and a destination intend to share secret information over a Gaussian channel in the presence of a wiretapper who observes the transmission through another Gaussian channel. Two constraints are imposed on the source-to-destination channel; namely, the source can transmit only binary phase-shift-keyed (BPSK) symbols, and symbol-by-symbol hard-decision quantization is applied to the received symbols of the destination. An error-free public channel is also available for the source and destination to exchange messages in order to help the secret-sharing process. The wiretapper can perfectly observe all messages in the public channel. It is shown that a secret-sharing scheme that employs a random ensemble of regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can achieve the key capacity of the BPSK-constrained Gaussian wiretap channel asymptotically with increasing block length. To accommodate practical constraints of finite block length and limited decoding complexity, fixed irregular LDPC codes are also designed to replace the regular LDPC code ensemble in the proposed secret-sharing scheme."

    title "non systematic codes for physical layer security"
    abstract "This paper is a first study on the topic of achieving physical layer security by exploiting non-systematic channel codes. The chance of implementing transmission security at the physical layer is known since many years in information theory, but it is now gaining an increasing interest due to its many possible applications. It has been shown that channel coding techniques can be effectively exploited for designing physical layer security schemes, able to ensure that an unauthorized receiver, experiencing a channel different from that of the the authorized receiver, is not able to gather any information. Recently, it has been proposed to exploit puncturing techniques in order to reduce the security gap between the authorized and unauthorized channels. In this paper, we show that the same target can also be achieved by using non-systematic codes, able to scramble information bits within the transmitted codeword."

    abstract "This paper investigates an efficient and practical information reconciliation method in the case where two parties have access to correlated continuous random variables. We show that reconciliation is a special case of channel coding and that existing coded modulation techniques can be adapted for reconciliation. We describe an explicit reconciliation method based on LDPC codes in the case of correlated Gaussian variables. We believe that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of quantum key distribution protocols based on continuous-spectrum quantum states."

    title "rate compatible protocol for information reconciliation an application to qkd"
    abstract "Information Reconciliation is a mechanism that allows to weed out the discrepancies between two correlated variables. It is an essential component in every key agreement protocol where the key has to be transmitted through a noisy channel. The typical case is in the satellite scenario described by Maurer in the early 90's. Recently the need has arisen in relation with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, where it is very important not to reveal unnecessary information in order to maximize the shared key length. In this paper we present an information reconciliation protocol based on a rate compatible construction of Low Density Parity Check codes. Our protocol improves the efficiency of the reconciliation for the whole range of error rates in the discrete variable QKD context. Its adaptability together with its low interactivity makes it specially well suited for QKD reconciliation."

    title "performance assessment and design of finite length ldpc codes for the gaussian wiretap channel"
    abstract "In this work we study the reliability and secrecy performance achievable by practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the Gaussian wiretap channel. While several works have already addressed this problem in asymptotic conditions, i.e., under the hypothesis of codewords of infinite length, only a few approaches exist for the finite length regime. We propose an approach to measure the performance of practical codes and compare it with that achievable in asymptotic conditions. Moreover, based on the secrecy metrics we adopt to achieve this target, we propose a code optimization algorithm which allows to design irregular LDPC codes able to approach the ultimate performance limits even at moderately small codeword lengths (in the order of 10000 bits)."

    title "improved reconciliation with polar codes in quantum key distribution"
    abstract "Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic system that generates an information-theoretically secure key shared by two legitimate parties. QKD consists of two parts: quantum and classical. The latter is referred to as classical post-processing (CPP). Information reconciliation is a part of CPP in which parties are given correlated variables and attempt to eliminate the discrepancies between them while disclosing a minimum amount of information. The elegant reconciliation protocol known as \emph{Cascade} was developed specifically for QKD in 1992 and has become the de-facto standard for all QKD implementations. However, the protocol is highly interactive. Thus, other protocols based on linear block codes such as Hamming codes, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and polar codes have been researched. In particular, reconciliation using LDPC codes has been mainly studied because of its outstanding performance. Nevertheless, with small block size, the bit error rate performance of polar codes under successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is comparable to state-of-the-art turbo and LDPC codes. In this study, we demonstrate the use of polar codes to improve the performance of information reconciliation in a QKD system with small block size. The best decoder for polar codes, a CRC-aided SCL decoder, requires CRC-precoded messages. However, messages that are sifted keys in QKD are obtained arbitrarily as a result of a characteristic of the QKD protocol and cannot be CRC-precoded. We propose a method that allows arbitrarily obtained sifted keys to be CRC precoded by introducing a virtual string. Thus the best decoder can be used for reconciliation using polar codes and improves the efficiency of the protocol."

    title "secret key agreement with large antenna arrays under the pilot contamination attack"
    abstract "We present a secret key agreement (SKA) protocol for a multi-user time-division duplex system where a base-station (BS) with a large antenna array (LAA) shares secret keys with users in the presence of non-colluding eavesdroppers. In the system, when the BS transmits random sequences to legitimate users for sharing common randomness, the eavesdroppers can attempt the pilot contamination attack (PCA) in which each of eavesdroppers transmits its target user's training sequence in hopes of acquiring possible information leak by steering beam towards the eavesdropper. We show that there exists a crucial complementary relation between the received signal strengths at the eavesdropper and its target user. This relation tells us that the eavesdropper inevitably leaves a trace that enables us to devise a way of measuring the amount of information leakage to the eavesdropper even if PCA parameters are unknown. To this end, we derive an estimator for the channel gain from the BS to the eavesdropper and propose a rate-adaptation scheme for adjusting the length of secret key under the PCA. Extensive analysis and evaluations are carried out under various setups, which show that the proposed scheme adequately takes advantage of the LAA to establish the secret keys under the PCA."

    title "secrecy transmission on block fading channels theoretical limits and performance of practical codes"
    abstract "We consider a system where an agent (Alice) aims at transmitting a message to a second agent (Bob), while keeping a third agent (Eve) in the dark, by using physical layer techniques. For a transmission over frequency non selective block fading channels, we assume that Alice perfectly knows the channel with respect to Bob, but she has only a statistical knowledge of the channel with respect to Eve. We derive bounds on the achievable outage secrecy rates, considering messages spanning either one or many fading blocks. Transmit power is adapted to fading conditions, with a constraint on the average power over the entire transmission. We also focus on the maximum cumulative outage secrecy rate that can be achieved. In order to assess the performance in a practical scenario, we consider transmissions encoded with practical error correcting codes. In particul ar, we extend the definitions of both security gap and equivocation rate &#8208; previously applied to the additive white Gaussian noise channel &#8208; to fading channels, taking into account the error rate targets. Bound s on these performance metrics are derived for a block Rayleigh fading channel. Numerical results are provided, confirming the feasibility of the considered physical layer security techniques."

    title "ldpc coded transmissions over the gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages"
    abstract "We design and assess some practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded transmission schemes for the Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCC). This channel model is different from the classical wiretap channel model as the unauthorized receiver (Eve) must be able to decode some part of the information. Hence, the reliability and security targets are different from those of the wiretap channel. In order to design and assess practical coding schemes, we use the error rate as a metric of the performance achieved by the authorized receiver (Bob) and the unauthorized receiver (Eve). We study the system feasibility, and show that two different levels of protection against noise are required on the public and the secret messages. This can be achieved in two ways: i) by using LDPC codes with unequal error protection (UEP) of the transmitted information bits or ii) by using two classical non-UEP LDPC codes with different rates. We compare these two approaches and show that, for the considered examples, the solution exploiting UEP LDPC codes is more efficient than that using non-UEP LDPC codes."

    abstract "The physical attributes of the dynamic vehicle-to-vehicle propagation channel can be utilized for the generation of highly random and symmetric cryptographic keys. However, in a physical-layer key agreement scheme, nonreciprocity due to inherent channel noise and hardware impairments can propagate bit disagreements. This has to be addressed prior to the symmetric key generation which is inherently important in Social Internet of Things networks, including in adversarial settings (e.g., battlefields). In this paper, we parametrically incorporate temporal variability attributes, such as 3-D scattering and scatterers&#8217; mobility. Accordingly, this is the first work to incorporate such features into the key generation process by combining nonreciprocity compensation with turbo codes (TCs). Preliminary results indicate a significant improvement when using TCs in bit mismatch rate and key generation rate in comparison to sample indexing techniques."

    abstract "Efficient information reconciliation is crucial in several scenarios, being quantum key distribution a remarkable example. However, efficiency is not the only requirement for determining the quality of the information reconciliation process. In some of these scenarios we find other relevant parameters such as the interactivity or the adaptability to different channel statistics. We propose an interactive protocol for information reconciliation based on low-density parity-check codes. The coding rate is adapted in real time by using simultaneously puncturing and shortening strategies, allowing it to cover a predefined error rate range with just a single code. The efficiency of the information reconciliation process using the proposed protocol is considerably better than the efficiency of its non-interactive version."

    title "practical ldpc coded modulation schemes for the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages"
    abstract "The broadcast channel with confidential messages is a well studied scenario from the theoretical standpoint, but there is still lack of practical schemes able to achieve some fixed level of reliability and security over such a channel. In this paper, we consider a quasi-static fading channel in which both public and private messages must be sent from the transmitter to the receivers, and we aim at designing suitable coding and modulation schemes to achieve such a target. For this purpose, we adopt the error rate as a metric, by considering that reliability (security) is achieved when a sufficiently low (high) error rate is experienced at the receiving side. We show that some conditions exist on the system feasibility, and that some outage probability must be tolerated to cope with the fading nature of the channel. The proposed solution exploits low-density parity-check codes with unequal error protection, which are able to guarantee two different levels of protection against noise for the public and the private information, in conjunction with different modulation schemes for the public and the private message bits."
