    title "a traffic load balancing framework for software defined radio access networks powered by hybrid energy sources"
    abstract "Dramatic mobile data traffic growth has spurred a dense deployment of small cell base stations (SCBSs). Small cells enhance the spectrum efficiency and thus enlarge the capacity of mobile networks. Although SCBSs consume much less power than macro BSs (MBSs) do, the overall power consumption of a large number of SCBSs is phenomenal. As the energy harvesting technology advances, base stations (BSs) can be powered by green energy to alleviate the on-grid power consumption. For mobile networks with high BS density, traffic load balancing is critical in order to exploit the capacity of SCBSs. To fully utilize harvested energy, it is desirable to incorporate the green energy utilization as a performance metric in traffic load balancing strategies. In this paper, we have proposed a traffic load balancing framework that strives a balance between network utilities, e.g., the average traffic delivery latency, and the green energy utilization. Various properties of the proposed framework have been derived. Leveraging the software-defined radio access network architecture, the proposed scheme is implemented as a virtually distributed algorithm, which significantly reduces the communication overheads between users and BSs. The simulation results show that the proposed traffic load balancing framework enables an adjustable trade-off between the on-grid power consumption and the average traffic delivery latency, and saves a considerable amount of on-grid power, e.g., 30%, at a cost of only a small increase, e.g., 8%, of the average traffic delivery latency."

    title "primal profit maximization avatar placement for mobile edge computing"
    abstract "We propose a cloudlet network architecture to bring the computing resources from the centralized cloud to the edge. Thus, each User Equipment (UE) can communicate with its Avatar, a software clone located in a cloudlet, with lower end-to-end (E2E) delay. However, UEs are moving over time, and so the low E2E delay may not be maintained if UEs' Avatars stay in their original cloudlets. Thus, live Avatar migration (i.e., migrating a UE's Avatar to a suitable cloudlet based on the UE's location) is enabled to maintain low E2E delay between each UE and its Avatar. On the other hand, the migration itself incurs extra overheads in terms of resources of the Avatar, which compromise the performance of applications running in the Avatar. By considering the gain (i.e., the E2E delay reduction) and the cost (i.e., the migration overheads) of the live Avatar migration, we propose a PRofIt Maximization Avatar pLacement (PRIMAL) strategy for the cloudlet network in order to optimize the tradeoff between the migration gain and the migration cost by selectively migrating the Avatars to their optimal locations. Simulation results demonstrate that as compared to the other two strategies (i.e., Follow Me Avatar and Static), PRIMAL maximizes the profit in terms of maintaining the low average E2E delay between UEs and their Avatars and minimizing the migration cost simultaneously."

    title "earning maximization with quality of charging service guarantee for iot devices"
    abstract "Resonant beam charging (RBC) is a promising wireless power transfer technology to provide long-range, high-power, mobile, and safe wireless power for the Internet of Things devices. The point-to-multipoint (PtMP) RBC system can charge multiple receivers simultaneously similar to WiFi communications. To guarantee the quality of charging service (QoCS) for each receiver and maximize the overall earning in the PtMP RBC service, we specify the charging pricing strategy and develop the high priority charge (HPC) scheduling algorithm to control the charging order and power allocation. Each receiver is assigned a priority, which is updated dynamically based on its state of charging (SOC) and specified charging power. The receivers with high priorities are scheduled to be charged in each time slot. We present the pseudo code of the HPC algorithm based on quantifying the receiver&#8217;s SOC, discharging energy, and various relevant parameters. Relying on simulation analysis, we demonstrate that the HPC algorithm can achieve better QoCS and earning than the round-robin charge scheduling algorithm. Based on the performance evaluation, we illustrate that the methods to improve the PtMP RBC service are: 1) limiting the receiver number within a reasonable range and 2) prolonging the charging duration as long as possible. In summary, the HPC scheduling algorithm provides a practical strategy to maximize the earning of the PtMP RBC service with each receiver&#8217;s QoCS guarantee."

    title "green cloudlet network a distributed green mobile cloud network"
    abstract "This article introduces a Green Cloudlet Network (GCN) architecture in the context of mobile cloud computing. The proposed architecture is aimed at providing seamless and low End-to-End (E2E) delay between a User Equipment (UE) and its Avatar (its software clone) in the cloudlets to facilitate the application workloads offloading process. Furthermore, Software Define Networking (SDN) based core network is introduced in the GCN architecture by replacing the traditional Evolved Packet Core (EPC) in the LTE network in order to provide efficient communications connections between different end points. Cloudlet Network File System (CNFS) is designed based on the proposed architecture in order to protect Avatars' dataset against hardware failure and improve the Avatars' performance in terms of data access latency. Moreover, green energy supplement is proposed in the architecture in order to reduce the extra Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and CO2 footprint incurred by running the distributed cloudlets. Owing to the temporal and spatial dynamics of both the green energy generation and energy demands of Green Cloudlet Systems (GCSs), designing an optimal green energy management strategy based on the characteristics of the green energy generation and the energy demands of eNBs and cloudlets to minimize the on-grid energy consumption is critical to the cloudlet provider."

    title "content caching and distribution in smart grid enabled wireless networks"
    abstract "To facilitate wireless transmission of multimedia content to mobile users, we propose a content caching and distribution framework for smart grid enabled OFDM networks, where each popular multimedia file is coded and distributively stored in multiple energy harvesting enabled serving nodes (SNs), and the green energy distributively harvested by SNs can be shared with each other through the smart grid. The distributive caching, green energy sharing and the on-grid energy backup have improved the reliability and performance of the wireless multimedia downloading process. To minimize the total on-grid power consumption of the whole network, while guaranteeing that each user can retrieve the whole content, the user association scheme is jointly designed with consideration of resource allocation, including subchannel assignment, power allocation and power flow among nodes, where the user association scheme decides which SN serves which user. First, the optimal power allocated to each subchannel and the power flows among nodes are derived analytically. Then, the user association problem is decoupled from the subchannel assignment problem, and the proposed user association scheme has leveraged the multicasting nature of the content download process. To decide which subchannel is assigned to which node, the number of subchannels assigned to each node is first determined, according to the green energy generating rate and the associated traffic offload, and then the corresponding subchannels are selected from the total assigned system spectrum. Simulation results demonstrate that bringing content, green energy and serving node closer to the end user can notably reduce the on-grid energy consumption."

    abstract "Cheating is a real problem in the Internet of Things. The fundamental question that needs to be answered is how we can trust the validity of the data being generated in the first place. The problem, however, isn't inherent in whether or not to embrace the idea of an open platform and open-source software, but to establish a methodology to verify the trustworthiness and control any access. This paper focuses on building an access control model and system based on trust computing. This is a new field of access control techniques which includes Access Control, Trust Computing, Internet of Things, network attacks, and cheating technologies. Nevertheless, the target access control systems can be very complex to manage. This paper presents an overview of the existing work on trust computing, access control models and systems in IoT. It not only summarizes the latest research progress, but also provides an understanding of the limitations and open issues of the existing work. It is expected to provide useful guidelines for future research."

    abstract "Everything in the world is being connected, and things are becoming interactive. The future of the interactive world depends on the future Internet of Things (IoT). Software-defined networking (SDN) technology, a new paradigm in the networking area, can be useful in creating an IoT because it can handle interactivity by controlling physical devices, transmission of data among them, and data acquisition. However, digital signage can be one of the promising technologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the interactive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device communication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is mainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined IoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have proposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and compatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea of invisible communication can ma..."

    title "enabling cognitive smart cities using big data and machine learning approaches and challenges"
    abstract "The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services."

    title "latency aware drone base station placement in heterogeneous networks"
    abstract "Different from traditional static small cells, Drone Base Stations (DBSs) exhibit their own advantages, i.e., faster and cheaper to deploy, more flexibly reconfigured, and likely to have better communications channels owing to the presence of short-range line-of-sight links. Thus, applying DBSs into the cellular network has great potential to increase the throughput of the network and improve Quality of Service (QoS) of Mobile Users (MUs). In this paper, we focus on how to place the DBS (i.e., jointly determining the location and the association coverage of a DBS) in order to improve the QoS in terms of minimizing the total average latency ratio of MUs by considering the energy capacity limitation of the DBS. We formulate the DBS placement problem as an optimization problem and design a Latency aware dronE bAse station Placement (LEAP) algorithm to solve it efficiently. The performance of LEAP is demonstrated via simulations as compared to other two baseline methods."

    title "a survey on mobile edge computing the communication perspective"
    abstract "Driven by the visions of Internet of Things and 5G communications, recent years have seen a paradigm shift in mobile computing, from the centralized Mobile Cloud Computing towards Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). The main feature of MEC is to push mobile computing, network control and storage to the network edges (e.g., base stations and access points) so as to enable computation-intensive and latency-critical applications at the resource-limited mobile devices. MEC promises dramatic reduction in latency and mobile energy consumption, tackling the key challenges for materializing 5G vision. The promised gains of MEC have motivated extensive efforts in both academia and industry on developing the technology. A main thrust of MEC research is to seamlessly merge the two disciplines of wireless communications and mobile computing, resulting in a wide-range of new designs ranging from techniques for computation offloading to network architectures. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art MEC research with a focus on joint radio-and-computational resource management. We also present a research outlook consisting of a set of promising directions for MEC research, including MEC system deployment, cache-enabled MEC, mobility management for MEC, green MEC, as well as privacy-aware MEC. Advancements in these directions will facilitate the transformation of MEC from theory to practice. Finally, we introduce recent standardization efforts on MEC as well as some typical MEC application scenarios."

The MEIoT architecture brings computing and storage resources close to Internet of Things (IoT) devices in order to speed up IoT data sharing and analytics. Specifically, the IoT devices (belonging to the same user) are associated to a specific proxy Virtual Machine (VM) in the nearby cloudlet. The proxy VM stores and analyzes the IoT data (generated by its IoT devices) in real-time. Moreover, we introduce the semantic and social IoT technology in the context of MEIoT to solve the interoperability and inefficient access control problem in the IoT system. In addition, we propose two dynamic proxy VM migration methods to minimize the end-to-end delay between proxy VMs and their IoT devices and to minimize the total on-grid energy consumption of the cloudlets, respectively. Performance of the proposed methods are validated via extensive simulations."

    title "cognitive internet of things a new paradigm beyond connection"
    abstract "Current research on Internet of Things (IoT) mainly focuses on how to enable general objects to see, hear, and smell the physical world for themselves, and make them connected to share the observations. In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds by themselves. This practical need impels us to develop a new paradigm, named Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), to empower the current IoT with a `brain' for high-level intelligence. Specifically, we first present a comprehensive definition for CIoT, primarily inspired by the effectiveness of human cognition. Then, we propose an operational framework of CIoT, which mainly characterizes the interactions among five fundamental cognitive tasks: perception-action cycle, massive data analytics, semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, intelligent decision-making, and on-demand service provisioning. Furthermore, we provide a systematic tutorial on key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks. In addition, we also discuss the design of proper performance metrics on evaluating the enabling techniques. Last but not least, we present the research challenges and open issues ahead. Building on the present work and potentially fruitful future studies, CIoT has the capability to bridge the physical world (with objects, resources, etc.) and the social world (with human demand, social behavior, etc.), and enhance smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning."

    abstract "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological topic with a very important societal impact. IoT application domains are various and include: smart cities, precision farming, smart factories, and smart buildings. The diversity of these application domains is the source of the very high technological heterogeneity in the IoT, leading to interoperability issues. The semantic web principles and technologies are more and more adopted as a solution to these interoperability issues, leading to the emergence of a new domain, the Semantic Web Of Things (SWoT). Scientific contributions to the SWoT are many, and the diversity of architectures in which they are expressed complicates comparison. To unify the presented architectures, we propose an architectural pattern, LMU-N. LMU-N provides a reading grid used to classify processes to which the SWoT community contributes, and to describe how the semantic web impacts the IoT. Then, the evolutions of the semantic web to adapt to the IoT constraints are described as well, in order to give a twofold view of the convergence between the IoT and the semantic web toward the SWoT."

    title "analysis of information delivery dynamics in cognitive sensor networks using epidemic models"
    abstract "To fully empower sensor networks with cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) technology, efficient medium access control protocols that enable the coexistence of cognitive sensor networks with current wireless infrastructure are as essential as the cognitive power in data fusion and processing due to shared wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio (CR) is introduced to increase spectrum efficiency and support such an endeavor, which thereby becomes a promising building block toward facilitating cognitive IoT. In this paper, primary users (PUs) refer to devices in existing wireless infrastructure, and secondary users (SUs) refer to cognitive sensors. For interference control between PUs and SUs, SUs adopt dynamic spectrum access and power adjustment to ensure sufficient operation of PUs, which inevitably leads to increasing latency and poses new challenges on the reliability of IoT communications. #R##N#To guarantee operations of primary systems while simultaneously optimizing system performance in cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs), this paper proposes interference-aware flooding schemes exploiting global timeout and vaccine recovery schemes to control the heavy buffer occupancy induced by packet replications. The information delivery dynamics of SUs under the proposed interference-aware recovery-assisted flooding schemes is analyzed via epidemic models and stochastic geometry from a macroscopic view of the entire system. The simulation results show that our model can efficiently capture the complicated data delivery dynamics in CRAHNs in terms of end-to-end transmission reliability and buffer occupancy. This paper sheds new light on analysis of recovery-assisted flooding schemes in CRAHNs and provides performance evaluation of cognitive IoT services built upon CRAHNs."

    abstract "In recent years, cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) has received considerable attention because it can extract valuable information from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In CIoT, truth discovery plays an important role in identifying truthful values from large scale data to help CIoT provide deeper insights and value from collected information. However, the privacy concerns of IoT devices pose a major challenge in designing truth discovery approaches. Although existing schemes of truth discovery can be executed with strong privacy guarantees, they are not efficient or cannot be applied in real-life CIoT applications. This article proposes a novel framework for lightweight and privacy-preserving truth discovery called LPTD-I, which is implemented by incorporating fog and cloud platforms, and adopting the homomorphic Paillier encryption and one-way hash chain techniques. This scheme not only protects devices' privacy, but also achieves high efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a fault tolerant (LPTD-II) framework which can effectively overcome malfunctioning CIoT devices. Detailed security analysis indicates the proposed schemes are secure under a comprehensively designed threat model. Experimental simulations are also carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes."

    abstract "As a long-range high-power wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, resonant beam charging (RBC) can transmit watt-level power over long distance for the devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to its open-loop architecture, RBC faces the challenge of providing dynamic current and voltage to optimize battery charging performance. In RBC, battery overcharge may cause energy waste, thermal effects, and even safety issues. On the other hand, battery undercharge may lead to charging time extension and significant battery capacity reduction. In this paper, we present an adaptive RBC (ARBC) system for battery charging optimization. Based on RBC, ARBC uses a feedback system to control the supplied power dynamically according to the battery preferred charging values. Moreover, in order to transform the received current and voltage to match the battery preferred charging values, ARBC adopts a dc&#8211;dc conversion circuit. Relying on the analytical models for RBC power transmission, we obtain the end-to-end power transfer relationship in the approximate linear closed-form of ARBC. Thus, the battery preferred charging power at the receiver can be mapped to the supplied power at the transmitter for feedback control. Numerical evaluation demonstrates that ARBC can save 61% battery charging energy and 53%&#8211;60% supplied energy compared with RBC. Furthermore, ARBC has high energy-saving gain over RBC when the WPT is unefficient. ARBC in WPT is similar to link adaption in wireless communications. Both of them play the important roles in their respective areas."

It is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. On the one hand, IoT play a crucial role in enhancing several real-life smart applications that can improve life quality. On the other hand, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network security and application security, for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to secure the IoT system effectively. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory curiosity to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML /DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions."

    abstract "We propose a Green Cloudlet Network (\emph{GCN}) architecture to provide seamless Mobile Cloud Computing (\emph{MCC}) services to User Equipments (\emph{UE}s) with low latency in which each cloudlet is powered by both green and brown energy. Fully utilizing green energy can significantly reduce the operational cost of cloudlet providers. However, owing to the spatial dynamics of energy demand and green energy generation, the energy gap among different cloudlets in the network is unbalanced, i.e., some cloudlets' energy demands can be fully provided by green energy but others need to utilize on-grid energy (i.e., brown energy) to satisfy their energy demands. We propose a Green-energy awarE Avatar migRation (\emph{GEAR}) strategy to minimize the on-grid energy consumption in GCN by redistributing the energy demands via Avatar migration among cloudlets according to cloudlets' green energy generation. Furthermore, GEAR ensures the Service Level Agreement (\emph{SLA}) in terms of the maximum Avatar propagation delay by avoiding Avatars hosted in the remote cloudlets. We formulate the GEAR strategy as a mixed integer linear programming problem, which is NP-hard, and thus apply the Branch and Bound search to find its sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that GEAR can save on-grid energy consumption significantly as compared to the Follow me AvataR (\emph{FAR}) migration strategy, which aims to minimize the propagation delay between an UE and its Avatar."
