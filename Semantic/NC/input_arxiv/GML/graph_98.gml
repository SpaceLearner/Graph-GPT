    title "joint time domain resource partitioning rate allocation and video quality adaptation in heterogeneous cellular networks"
    abstract "Heterogenous cellular networks (HCN) introduce small cells within the transmission range of a macrocell. For the efficient operation of HCNs it is essential that the high-power macrocell shuts off its transmissions for an appropriate amount of time in order for the low-power small cells to transmit. This is a mechanism that allows time-domain resource partitioning (TDRP) and is critical to be optimized for maximizing the throughput of the complete HCN. In this paper, we investigate video communication in HCNs when TDRP is employed. After defining a detailed system model for video streaming in such an HCN, we consider the problem of maximizing the experienced video quality at all the users, by jointly optimizing the TDRP for the HCN, the rate allocated to each specific user, and the selected video quality transmitted to a user. The NP-hard problem is solved with a primal-dual approximation algorithm that decomposes the problem into simpler subproblems, making them amenable to fast well-known solution algorithms. Consequently , the calculated solution can be enforced in the time scale of real-life video streaming sessions. This last observation motivates the enhancement of the proposed framework to support video delivery with dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH). Our extensive simulation results demonstrate clearly the need for our holistic approach for improving the video quality and playback performance of the video streaming users in HCNs."

    title "enhanced intercell interference coordination challenges in heterogeneous networks"
    abstract "3GPP LTE-Advanced has recently been investigating heterogeneous network (HetNet) deployments as a cost effective way to deal with the unrelenting traffic demand. HetNets consist of a mix of macrocells, remote radio heads, and low-power nodes such as picocells, femtocells, and relays. Leveraging network topology, increasing the proximity between the access network and the end users, has the potential to provide the next significant performance leap in wireless networks, improving spatial spectrum reuse and enhancing indoor coverage. Nevertheless, deployment of a large number of small cells overlaying the macrocells is not without new technical challenges. In this article, we present the concept of heterogeneous networks and also describe the major technical challenges associated with such network architecture. We focus in particular on the standardization activities within the 3GPP related to enhanced intercell interference coordination."

    title "separation framework an enabler for cooperative and d2d communication for future 5g networks"
    abstract "Soaring capacity and coverage demands dictate that future cellular networks need to migrate soon toward ultra-dense networks. However, network densification comes with a host of challenges that include compromised energy efficiency, complex interference management, cumbersome mobility management, burdensome signaling overheads, and higher backhaul costs. Interestingly, most of the problems that beleaguer network densification stem from legacy networks' one common feature, i.e., tight coupling between the control and data planes regardless of their degree of heterogeneity and cell density. Consequently, in wake of 5G, control and data planes separation architecture (SARC) has recently been conceived as a promising paradigm that has potential to address most of the aforementioned challenges. In this survey, we review various proposals that have been presented in the literature so far to enable SARC. More specifically, we analyze how and to what degree various SARC proposals address the four main challenges in network densification, namely: energy efficiency, system level capacity maximization, interference management, and mobility management. We then focus on two salient features of future cellular networks that have not yet been adapted in legacy networks at wide scale and thus remain a hallmark of 5G, i.e., coordinated multipoint (CoMP) and device-to-device (D2D) communications. After providing necessary background on CoMP and D2D, we analyze how SARC can particularly act as a major enabler for CoMP and D2D in context of 5G. This article thus serves as both a tutorial as well as an up-to-date survey on SARC, CoMP, and D2D. Most importantly, this survey provides an extensive outlook of challenges and opportunities that lie at the crossroads of these three mutually entangled emerging technologies."

    title "optimization of mimo device to device networks via matrix fractional programming a minorization maximization approach"
    abstract "Interference management is a fundamental issue in device-to-device (D2D) communications whenever the transmitter-and-receiver pairs are located in close proximity and frequencies are fully reused, so active links may severely interfere with each other. This paper devises an optimization strategy named FPLinQ to coordinate the link scheduling decisions among the interfering links, along with power control and beamforming. The key enabler is a novel optimization method called matrix fractional programming (FP) that generalizes previous scalar and vector forms of FP in allowing multiple data streams per link. From a theoretical perspective, this paper provides a deeper understanding of FP by showing a connection to the minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm. From an application perspective, this paper shows that as compared to the existing methods for coordinating scheduling in the D2D network, such as FlashLinQ, ITLinQ, and ITLinQ+, the proposed FPLinQ approach is more general in allowing multiple antennas at both the transmitters and the receivers, and further in allowing arbitrary and multiple possible associations between the devices via matching. Numerical results show that FPLinQ significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in a typical D2D communication environment."

    title "optimal hierarchical radio resource management for hetnets with flexible backhaul"
    abstract "Providing backhaul connectivity for macro and pico base stations (BSs) constitutes a significant share of infrastructure costs in future heterogeneous networks (HetNets). To address this issue, the emerging idea of  flexible backhaul  is proposed. Under this architecture, not all the pico BSs are connected to the backhaul, resulting in a significant reduction in the infrastructure costs. In this regard, pico BSs without backhaul connectivity need to communicate with their nearby BSs in order to have indirect accessibility to the backhaul. This makes the radio resource management (RRM) in such networks more complex and challenging. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-layer RRM in HetNets with flexible backhaul. We formulate this problem as a two-timescale non-convex stochastic optimization, which jointly optimizes flow control, routing, interference mitigation, and link scheduling in order to maximize a generic network utility. By exploiting a  hidden convexity  of this non-convex problem, we propose an iterative algorithm which converges to the global optimal solution. The proposed algorithm benefits from low complexity and low signaling, which makes it scalable. Moreover, due to the proposed two-timescale design, it is robust to the backhaul signaling latency as well. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gain of the proposed solution over various baselines."

    title "joint resource allocation for eicic in heterogeneous networks"
    abstract "Interference coordination between high-power macros and low-power picos deeply impacts the performance of heterogeneous networks (HetNets). It should deal with three challenges: user association with macros and picos, the amount of almost blank subframe (ABS) that macros should reserve for picos, and resource block (RB) allocation strategy in each eNB. We formulate the three issues jointly for sum weighted logarithmic utility maximization while maintaining proportional fairness of users. A class of distributed algorithms are developed to solve the joint optimization problem. Our framework can be deployed for enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) in existing LTE-A protocols. Extensive evaluation are performed to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms."

    title "gaussian approximation for the downlink interference in heterogeneous cellular networks"
    abstract "This paper derives Gaussian approximation bounds for the standardized aggregate wireless interference (AWI) in the downlink of K-tier heterogeneous cellular networks when base stations in each tier are distributed over the plane according to a (possibly non-homogeneous) Poisson process. The proposed methodology is general enough to account for general bounded path-loss models and fading statistics. The deviations of the distribution of the standardized AWI from the standard normal distribution are measured in terms of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. An explicit expression bounding the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between these two distributions is obtained as a function of a broad range of network parameters such as per-tier transmission power levels, base station locations, fading statistics and the path-loss model. A simulation study is performed to corroborate the analytical results. In particular, a good statistical match between the standardized AWI distribution and its normal approximation occurs even for moderately dense heterogeneous cellular networks. These results are expected to have important ramifications on the characterization of performance upper and lower bounds for emerging 5G network architectures."

    title "enhanced inter cell interference coordination for heterogeneous networks in lte advanced a survey"
    abstract "Heterogeneous networks (het-nets) - comprising of conventional macrocell base stations overlaid with femtocells, picocells and wireless relays - offer cellular operators burgeoning traffic demands through cell-splitting gains obtained by bringing users closer to their access points. However, the often random and unplanned location of these access points can cause severe near-far problems, typically solved by coordinating base-station transmissions to minimize interference. Towards this direction, the 3rd generation partnership project Long Term Evolution-Advanced (3GPP-LTE or Rel-10) standard introduces time-domain inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) for facilitating a seamless deployment of a het-net overlay. This article surveys the key features encompassing the physical layer, network layer and back-hauling aspects of time-domain ICIC in Rel-10."

    title "automated dynamic offset applied to cell association"
    abstract "In this paper, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian game framework for automated dynamic offset selection. Users compete to maximize their throughput by picking the best locally serving radio access network (RAN) with respect to their own measurement, their demand and a partial statistical channel state information (CSI) of other users. In particular, we investigate the properties of a Stackelberg game, in which the base station is a player on its own. We derive analytically the utilities related to the channel quality perceived by users to obtain the equilibria. We study the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of such system, where the PoA is the ratio of the social welfare attained when a network planner chooses policies to maximize social welfare versus the social welfare attained in Nash/Stackeleberg equilibrium when users choose their policies strategically. We show by means of a Stackelberg formulation, how the operator, by sending appropriate information about the state of the channel, can configure a dynamic offset that optimizes its global utility while users maximize their individual utilities. The proposed hierarchical decision approach for wireless networks can reach a good trade-off between the global network performance at the equilibrium and the requested amount of signaling. Typically, it is shown that when the network goal is orthogonal to user's goal, this can lead the users to a misleading association problem."

    title "self organizing strategies for enhanced icic eicic"
    abstract "Small cells have been identified as an effective solution for coping with the important traffic increase that is expected in the coming years. But this solution is accompanied by additional interference that needs to be mitigated. The enhanced Inter Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) feature has been introduced to address the interference problem. eICIC involves two parameters which need to be optimized, namely the Cell Range Extension (CRE) of the small cells and the ABS ratio (ABSr) which defines a mute ratio for the macro cell to reduce the interference it produces. In this paper we propose self-optimizing algorithms for the eICIC. The CRE is adjusted by means of load balancing algorithm. The ABSr parameter is optimized by maximizing a proportional fair utility of user throughputs. The convergence of the algorithms is proven using stochastic approximation theorems. Numerical simulations illustrate the important performance gain brought about by the different algorithms."

    title "downlink transmit power setting in lte hetnets with carrier aggregation"
    abstract "Carrier aggregation, which allows users to aggregate several component carriers to obtain up to 100 MHz of bandwidth, is one of the central features envisioned for next generation cellular networks. While this feature will enable support for higher data rates and improve quality of service, it may also be employed as an effective interference mitigation technique, especially in multi-tier heterogeneous networks. Having in mind that the aggregated component carriers may belong to different frequency bands and, hence, have varying propagation profiles, we argue that it is not necessary, indeed even harmful, to transmit at maximum power at all carriers, at all times. Rather, by using game theory, we design a distributed algorithm that lets eNodeBs and micro base stations dynamically adjust the downlink transmit power for the different component carriers. We compare our scheme to different power strategies combined with popular interference mitigation techniques, in a typical large-scale scenario, and show that our solution significantly outperforms the other strategies in terms of global network utility, power consumption and user throughput."

    title "optimal joint user association and resource allocation in heterogeneous networks via sparsity pursuit"
    abstract "This paper studies the joint user association and resource allocation in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) from a novel perspective, motivated by and generalizing the idea of fractional frequency reuse. By treating the multi-cell multi-user resource allocation as resource partitioning among multiple reuse patterns, we propose a unified framework to analyze and compare a wide range of user association and resource allocation strategies for HetNets, and provide an optimal benchmark for network performance. The enabling mechanisms are a novel formulation to consider all possible interference patterns or any pre-defined subset of patterns, and efficient sparsity-pursuit algorithms to find the solution. A notable feature of this formulation is that the patterns remain fixed during the resource optimization process. This creates a favorable opportunity for convex formulations while still considering interference coupling. More importantly, in view of the fact that multi-cell resource allocation is very computational demanding, our framework provides a systematic way to trade off performance for the reduction of computational complexity by restricting the candidate patterns to a small number of feature patterns. Relying on the sparsity-pursuit capability of the proposed algorithms, we develop a practical guideline to identify the feature patterns. Numerical results show that the identified feature patterns can significantly improve the existing strategies, and jointly optimizing the user association and resource allocation indeed brings considerable gain."

    abstract "The fifth generation (5G)&#160;mobile networks are envisioned to support the deluge of data traffic with reduced energy consumption and improved quality of service (QoS)&#160;provision. To this end, key enabling technologies, such as heterogeneous networks (HetNets), massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and millimeter wave (mmWave)&#160;techniques, have been identified to bring 5G to fruition. Regardless of the technology adopted, a user association mechanism is needed to determine whether a user is associated with a particular base station (BS)&#160;before data transmission commences. User association plays a pivotal role in enhancing the load balancing, the spectrum efficiency, and the energy efficiency of networks. The emerging 5G networks introduce numerous challenges and opportunities for the design of sophisticated user association mechanisms. Hence, substantial research efforts are dedicated to the issues of user association in HetNets, massive MIMO networks, mmWave networks, and energy harvesting networks. We introduce a taxonomy as a framework for systematically studying the existing user association algorithms. Based on the proposed taxonomy, we then proceed to present an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art in user association algorithms conceived for HetNets, massive MIMO, mmWave, and energy harvesting networks. Finally, we summarize the challenges as well as opportunities of user association in 5G and provide design guidelines and potential solutions for sophisticated user association mechanisms."

    title "fast resource scheduling in hetnets with d2d support"
    abstract "Resource allocation in LTE networks is known to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we address an even more complex scenario: an LTE-based, 2-tier heterogeneous network where D2D mode is supported under the network control. All communications (macrocell, microcell and D2D-based) share the same frequency bands, hence they may interfere. We then determine (i) the network node that should serve each user and (ii) the radio resources to be scheduled for such communication. To this end, we develop an accurate model of the system and apply approximate dynamic programming to solve it. Our algorithms allow us to deal with realistic, large-scale scenarios. In such scenarios, we compare our approach to today's networks where eICIC techniques and proportional fairness scheduling are implemented. Results highlight that our solution increases the system throughput while greatly reducing energy consumption. We also show that D2D mode can effectively support content delivery without significantly harming macrocells or microcells traffic, leading to an increased system capacity. Interestingly, we find that D2D mode can be a low-cost alternative to microcells."

    title "towards 1 gbps ue in cellular systems understanding ultra dense small cell deployments"
    abstract "Today's heterogeneous networks comprised of mostly macrocells and indoor small cells will not be able to meet the upcoming traffic demands. Indeed, it is forecasted that at least a    $100\times$   network capacity increase will be required to meet the traffic demands in 2020. As a result, vendors and operators are now looking at using every tool at hand to improve network capacity. In this epic campaign, three paradigms are noteworthy, i.e., network densification, the use of higher frequency bands and spectral efficiency enhancement techniques. This paper aims at bringing further common understanding and analysing the potential gains and limitations of these three paradigms, together with the impact of idle mode capabilities at the small cells as well as the user equipment density and distribution in outdoor scenarios. Special attention is paid to network densification and its implications when transiting to ultra-dense small cell deployments. Simulation results show that comparing to the baseline case with an average inter site distance of 200 m and a 100 MHz bandwidth, network densification with an average inter site distance of 35 m can increase the average UE throughput by    $7.56\times$  , while the use of the 10 GHz band with a 500 MHz bandwidth can further increase the network capacity up to    $5\times$  , resulting in an average of 1.27 Gbps per UE. The use of beamforming with up to 4 antennas per small cell BS lacks behind with average throughput gains around 30% and cell-edge throughput gains of up to    $2\times$  . Considering an extreme densification, an average inter site distance of 5 m can increase the average and cell-edge UE throughput by    $18\times$   and    $48\times$  , respectively. Our study also shows how network densification reduces multi-user diversity, and thus proportional fair alike schedulers start losing their advantages with respect to round robin ones. The energy efficiency of these ultra-dense small cell deployments is also analysed, indicating the benefits of energy harvesting approaches to make these deployments more energy-efficient. Finally, the top ten challenges to be addressed to bring ultra-dense small cell deployments to reality are also discussed."

    title "licensed and unlicensed spectrum allocation in heterogeneous networks"
    abstract "In future networks, an operator may employ a wide range of access points using diverse radio access technologies (RATs) over multiple licensed and unlicensed frequency bands. This paper studies centralized user association and spectrum allocation across many access points in such a heterogeneous network (HetNet). Such centralized control is on a relatively slow timescale to allow information exchange and joint optimization over multiple cells. This is in contrast and complementary to fast timescale distributed scheduling. A queueing model is introduced to capture the lower spectral efficiency, reliability, and additional delays of data transmission over the unlicensed bands due to contention and/or listen-before-talk requirements. Two optimization-based spectrum allocation schemes are proposed along with efficient algorithms for computing the allocations. The proposed solutions are fully aware of traffic loads, network topology, as well as external interference levels in the unlicensed bands. Packet-level simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform orthogonal and full-frequency-reuse allocations under all traffic conditions."

    title "dual timescale spectrum management in wireless heterogeneous networks"
    abstract "To attain the targeted data rates of next generation (5G) cellular networks requires dense deployment of small cells in addition to macro cells which provide wide coverage. Dynamic radio resource management (RRM) is crucial to the success of such heterogeneous networks due to much more pronounced traffic and interference variations in small cells. This work proposes a framework for spectrum management organized according to two timescales, which includes 1) centralized optimization on a second/minute timescale corresponding to typical durations of user sessions, and 2) distributed spectrum allocation on a millisecond timescale corresponding to typical latency requirements. The dual-timescale allocation is formulated as an optimization problem in the slower timescale with consideration of (distributed) opportunistic scheduling on the faster timescale. We consider both fixed and fully flexible user association. Iterative algorithms are developed to solve these optimization problems efficiently for a small cluster of cells. Simulation results demonstrate advantages of the dual-timescale RRM framework."

Two important challenges in this context are: 1) determining the amount of radio resources that macrocells should offer to picocells, and 2) determining the association rules that decide which user equipments (UEs) should associate with picos. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm to solve these two coupled problems in a joint manner. Our algorithm has provable guarantee, and furthermore, it accounts for network topology, traffic load, and macro-pico interference map. Our solution is standard compliant and can be implemented using the notion of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS) and Cell Selection Bias (CSB) proposed by LTE standards.
