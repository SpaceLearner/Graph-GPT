    title "tsallis q exponential describes the distribution of scientific citations a new characterization of the impact"
    abstract "In this work we have studied the research activity for countries of Europe, Latin America and Africa for all sciences between 1945 and November 2008. All the data are captured from the Web of Science database during this period. The analysis of the experimental data shows that, within a nonextensive thermostatistical formalism, the Tsallis \emph{q}-exponential distribution $N(c)$ satisfactorily describes Institute of Scientific Information citations. The data which are examined in the present survey can be fitted successfully as a first approach by applying a {\it single} curve (namely, $N(c) \propto 1/[1+(q-1) c/T]^{\frac{1}{q-1}}$ with $q\simeq 4/3$ for {\it all} the available citations $c$, $T$ being an &#34;effective temperature&#34;. The present analysis ultimately suggests that the phenomenon might essentially be {\it one and the same} along the {\it entire} range of the citation number. Finally, this manuscript provides a new ranking index, via the &#34;effective temperature&#34; $T$, for the impact level of the research activity in these countries, taking into account the number of the publications and their citations."

    title "the precision of the arithmetic mean geometric mean and percentiles for citation data an experimental simulation modelling approach"
    abstract "When comparing the citation impact of nations, departments or other groups of researchers within individual fields, three approaches have been proposed: arithmetic means, geometric means, and percentage in the top X%. This article compares the precision of these statistics using 97 trillion experimentally simulated citation counts from 6875 sets of different parameters (although all having the same scale parameter) based upon the discretised lognormal distribution with limits from 1000 repetitions for each parameter set. The results show that the geometric mean is the most precise, closely followed by the percentage of a country's articles in the top 50% most cited articles for a field, year and document type. Thus the geometric mean citation count is recommended for future citation-based comparisons between nations. The percentage of a country's articles in the top 1% most cited is a particularly imprecise indicator and is not recommended for international comparisons based on individual fields. Moreover, whereas standard confidence interval formulae for the geometric mean appear to be accurate, confidence interval formulae are less accurate and consistent for percentile indicators. These recommendations assume that the scale parameters of the samples are the same but the choice of indicator is complex and partly conceptual if they are not."

    title "hegemonic structure of basic clinical and patented knowledge on ebola research a us army reductionist initiative"
    abstract "Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebola) is still a highly lethal infectious disease long affecting mainly neglected populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, this disease is now considered a potential worldwide threat. In this paper, we present an approach to understand how the basic, clinical and patent knowledge on Ebola is organized and intercommunicated and what leading factor could be shaping the evolution of the knowledge translation process for this disease. A combination of citation network analysis; analysis of Medical heading Subject (MeSH) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and quantitative content analysis for patents and scientific literature, aimed to map the organization of Ebola research was carried out. We found six putative research fronts (i.e. clusters of high interconnected papers). Three research fronts are basic research on Ebola virus structural proteins: glycoprotein, VP40 and VP35, respectively. There is a fourth research front of basic research papers on pathogenesis, which is the organizing hub of Ebola research. A fifth research front is pre-clinical research focused on vaccines and glycoproteins. Finally, a clinical-epidemiology research front related to the disease outbreaks was identified. The network structure of patent families shows that the dominant design is the use of Ebola virus proteins as targets of vaccines and other immunological treatments. Therefore, patents network organization resembles the organization of the scientific literature. Specifically, the knowledge on Ebola would flow from higher (clinical-epidemiology) to intermediated (cellular-tissular pathogenesis) to lower (molecular interactions) levels of organization. Our results suggest a strong reductionist approach for Ebola research probably influenced by the lethality of the disease. On the other hand, the ownership profile of the patent families network and the main researches relationship with the United State Army suggest a strong involvement of this military institution in Ebola research."

    title "are there too many uncited articles zero inflated variants of the discretised lognormal and hooked power law distributions"
    abstract "Although statistical models fit many citation data sets reasonably well with the best fitting models being the hooked power law and discretised lognormal distribution, the fits are rarely close. One possible reason is that there might be more uncited articles than would be predicted by any model if some articles are inherently uncitable. Using data from 23 different Scopus categories, this article tests the assumption that removing a proportion of uncited articles from a citation dataset allows statistical distributions to have much closer fits. It also introduces two new models, zero inflated discretised lognormal distribution and the zero inflated hooked power law distribution and algorithms to fit them. In all 23 cases, the zero inflated version of the discretised lognormal distribution was an improvement on the standard version and in 16 out of 23 cases the zero inflated version of the hooked power law was an improvement on the standard version. Without zero inflation the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 6 out of 23 times and with it, the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 9 out of 23 times. Apparently uncitable articles seem to occur due to the presence of academic-related magazines in Scopus categories. In conclusion, future citation analysis and research indicators should take into account uncitable articles, and the best fitting distribution for sets of citation counts from a single subject and year is either the zero inflated discretised lognormal or zero inflated hooked power law."

    title "the emergence and evolution of the research fronts in hiv aids research"
    abstract "In this paper, we have identified and analyzed the emergence, structure and dynamics of the paradigmatic research fronts that established the fundamentals of the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A search of papers with the identifiers &#34;HIV/AIDS&#34;, &#34;Human Immunodeficiency Virus&#34;, &#8220;HIV-1&#8221; and &#34;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome&#34; in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), was carried out. A citation network of those papers was constructed. Then, a sub-network of the papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree of 28) was selected to perform a combination of network clustering and text mining to identify the paradigmatic research fronts and analyze their dynamics. Thirteen research fronts were identified in this sub-network. The biggest and oldest front is related to the clinical knowledge on the disease in the patient. Nine of the fronts are related to the study of specific molecular structures and mechanisms and two of these fronts are related to the development of drugs. The rest of the fronts are related to the study of the disease at the cellular level. Interestingly, the emergence of these fronts occurred in successive &#34;waves&#34; over the time which suggest a transition in the paradigmatic focus. The emergence and evolution of the biomedical fronts in HIV/AIDS research is explained not just by the partition of the problem in elements and interactions leading to increasingly specialized communities, but also by changes in the technological context of this health problem and the dramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of HIV/AIDS that occurred between 1993 and 1995."

    title "the stability of twitter metrics a study on unavailable twitter mentions of scientific publications"
    abstract "This paper investigates the stability of Twitter counts of scientific publications over time. For this, we conducted an analysis of the availability statuses of over 2.6 million Twitter mentions received by the 1,154 most tweeted scientific publications recorded by this http URL up to October 2017. Results show that of the Twitter mentions for these highly tweeted publications, about 14.3% have become unavailable by April 2019. Deletion of tweets by users is the main reason for unavailability, followed by suspension and protection of Twitter user accounts. This study proposes two measures for describing the Twitter dissemination structures of publications: Degree of Originality (i.e., the proportion of original tweets received by a paper) and Degree of Concentration (i.e., the degree to which retweets concentrate on a single original tweet). Twitter metrics of publications with relatively low Degree of Originality and relatively high Degree of Concentration are observed to be at greater risk of becoming unstable due to the potential disappearance of their Twitter mentions. In light of these results, we emphasize the importance of paying attention to the potential risk of unstable Twitter counts, and the significance of identifying the different Twitter dissemination structures when studying the Twitter metrics of scientific publications."

    title "the relationship between the number of authors of a publication its citations and the impact factor of the publishing journal evidence from italy"
    abstract "Empirical evidence shows that co-authored publications achieve higher visibility and impact. The aim of the current work is to test for the existence of a similar correlation for Italian publications. We also verify if such correlation differs: (i) by subject category and macro-area; (ii) by document type; (iii) over the course of time. The results confirm world-level evidence, showing a consistent and significant linear growth in the citability of a publication with number of co-authors, in almost all subject categories. The effects are more remarkable in the fields of Social Sciences and Art &#38; Humanities than in the Sciences &#8211; a finding not so obvious scrutinizing previous studies. Moreover, our results partly disavow the positive association between number of authors and prestige of the journal, as measured by its impact factor."

    abstract "This study provides an overview of science from the Wikipedia perspective. A methodology has been established for the analysis of how Wikipedia editors regard science through their references to scientific papers. The method of co-citation has been adapted to this context in order to generate Pathfinder networks (PFNET) that highlight the most relevant scientific journals and categories, and their interactions in order to find out how scientific literature is consumed through this open encyclopaedia. In addition to this, their obsolescence has been studied through Price index. A total of 1 433 457 references available at Altmetric.com have been initially taken into account. After pre-processing and linking them to the data from Elsevier's CiteScore Metrics the sample was reduced to 847 512 references made by 193 802 Wikipedia articles to 598 746 scientific articles belonging to 14 149 journals indexed in Scopus. As highlighted results we found a significative presence of &#8220;Medicine&#8221; and &#8220;Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology&#8221; papers and that the most important journals are multidisciplinary in nature, suggesting also that high-impact factor journals were more likely to be cited. Furthermore, only 13.44% of Wikipedia citations are to Open Access journals."

    title "citation count distributions for large monodisciplinary journals"
    abstract "Many different citation-based indicators are used by researchers and research evaluators to help evaluate the impact of scholarly outputs. Although the appropriateness of individual citation indicators depends in part on the statistical properties of citation counts, there is no universally agreed best-fitting statistical distribution against which to check them. The two current leading candidates are the discretised lognormal and the hooked or shifted power law. These have been mainly tested on sets of articles from a single field and year but these collections can include multiple specialisms that might dilute their properties. This article fits statistical distributions to 50 large subject-specific journals in the belief that individual journals can be purer than subject categories and may therefore give clearer findings. The results show that in most cases the discretised lognormal fits significantly better than the hooked power law, reversing previous findings for entire subcategories. This suggests that the discretised lognormal is the more appropriate distribution for modelling pure citation data. Thus, future analytical investigations of the properties of citation indicators can use the lognormal distribution to analyse their basic properties. This article also includes improved software for fitting the hooked power law."

    abstract "This research maps the knowledge translation process for two different types of nanotechnologies applied to cancer: liposomes and metallic nanostructures (MNs). We performed a structural analysis of citation networks and text mining supported in controlled vocabularies. In the case of liposomes, our results identify subnetworks (invisible colleges) associated with different therapeutic strategies: nanopharmacology, hyperthermia, and gene therapy. Only in the pharmacological strategy was an organized knowledge translation process identified, which, however, is monopolized by the liposomal doxorubicins. In the case of MNs, subnetworks are not differentiated by the type of therapeutic strategy, and the content of the documents is still basic research. Research on MNs is highly focused on developing a combination of molecular imaging and photothermal therapy."

    abstract "Nowadays, the world&#8217;s scientific community has been publishing an enormous number of papers in different scientific fields. In such environment, it is essential to know which databases are equally efficient and objective for literature searches. It seems that two most extensive databases are Web of Science and Scopus. Besides searching the literature, these two databases used to rank journals in terms of their productivity and the total citations received to indicate the journals impact, prestige or influence. This article attempts to provide a comprehensive comparison of these databases to answer frequent questions which researchers ask, such as: How Web of Science and Scopus are different? In which aspects these two databases are similar? Or, if the researchers are forced to choose one of them, which one should they prefer? For answering these questions, these two databases will be compared based on their qualitative and quantitative characteristics."

    title "the effects of research level and article type on the differences between citation metrics and f1000 recommendations"
    abstract "F1000 recommendations have been validated as a potential data source for research evaluation, but reasons for differences between F1000 Article Factor (FFa scores) and citations remain to be explored. By linking 28254 publications in F1000 to citations in Scopus, we investigated the effect of research level and article type on the internal consistency of assessments based on citations and FFa scores. It turns out that research level has little impact, while article type has big effect on the differences. These two measures are significantly different for two groups: non-primary research or evidence-based research publications are more highly cited rather than highly recommended, however, translational research or transformative research publications are more highly recommended by faculty members but gather relatively lower citations. This can be expected because citation activities are usually practiced by academic authors while the potential for scientific revolutions and the suitability for clinical practice of an article should be investigated from the practitioners' points of view. We conclude with a policy relevant recommendation that the application of bibliometric approaches in research evaluation procedures should include the proportion of three types of publications: evidence-based research, transformative research, and translational research. The latter two types are more suitable to be assessed through peer review."

    title "are the discretised lognormal and hooked power law distributions plausible for citation data"
    abstract "There is no agreement over which statistical distribution is most appropriate for modelling citation count data. This is important because if one distribution is accepted then the relative merits of different citation-based indicators, such as percentiles, arithmetic means and geometric means, can be more fully assessed. In response, this article investigates the plausibility of the discretised lognormal and hooked power law distributions for modelling the full range of citation counts, with an offset of 1. The citation counts from 23 Scopus subcategories were fitted to hooked power law and discretised lognormal distributions but both distributions failed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test in over three quarters of cases. The discretised lognormal distribution also seems to have the wrong shape for citation distributions, with too few zeros and not enough medium values for all subjects. The cause of poor fits could be the impurity of the subject subcategories or the presence of interdisciplinary research. Although it is possible to test for subject subcategory purity indirectly through a goodness of fit test in theory with large enough sample sizes, it is probably not possible in practice. Hence it seems difficult to get conclusive evidence about the theoretically most appropriate statistical distribution."

We analyzed 829,924 articles that received 16,490,346 citations. The number of articles published through collaboration account for 89%. The citation-based performance and collaboration patterns exhibit a power-law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.20 &#177; 0.07. Citations to a subfield&#8217;s research articles tended to increase 2.1.20 or 2.30 times each time it doubles the number of collaborative papers. The scaling exponent for the power-law relationship for single-authored papers was 0.85 &#177; 0.11. The citations to a subfield&#8217;s single-authored research articles increased 2.0.85 or 1.89 times each time the research area doubles the number of non-collaborative papers. The Matthew effect is stronger for collaborated papers than for single-authored. In fact, with a scaling exponent < 1.0 the impact of single-author papers exhibits a cumulative disadvantage or inverse Matthew effect."

    title "analysis of reference and citation copying in evolving bibliographic networks"
    abstract "Extensive literature demonstrates how the copying of references (links) can lead to the emergence of various structural properties (e.g., power-law degree distribution and bipartite cores) in bibliographic and other similar directed networks. However, it is also well known that the copying process is incapable of mimicking the number of directed triangles in such networks; neither does it have the power to explain the obsolescence of older papers. In this paper, we propose RefOrCite, a new model that allows for copying of both the references from (i.e., out-neighbors of) as well as the citations to (i.e., in-neighbors of) an existing node. In contrast, the standard copying model (CP) only copies references. While retaining its spirit, RefOrCite differs from the Forest Fire (FF) model in ways that makes RefOrCite amenable to mean-field analysis for degree distribution, triangle count, and densification. Empirically, RefOrCite gives the best overall agreement with observed degree distribution, triangle count, diameter, h-index, and the growth of citations to newer papers."

    title "on the heterogeneous distributions in paper citations"
    abstract "Academic papers have been the protagonists in disseminating expertise. Naturally, paper citation pattern analysis is an efficient and essential way of investigating the knowledge structure of science and technology. For decades, it has been observed that citation of scientific literature follows a heterogeneous and heavy-tailed distribution, and many of them suggest a power-law distribution, log-normal distribution, and related distributions. However, many studies are limited to small-scale approaches; therefore, it is hard to generalize. To overcome this problem, we investigate 21 years of citation evolution through a systematic analysis of the entire citation history of 42,423,644 scientific literatures published from 1996 to 2016 and contained in SCOPUS. We tested six candidate distributions for the scientific literature in three distinct levels of Scimago Journal &#38; Country Rank (SJR) classification scheme. First, we observe that the raw number of annual citation acquisitions tends to follow the log-normal distribution for all disciplines, except for the first year of the publication. We also find significant disparity between the yearly acquired citation number among the journals, which suggests that it is essential to remove the citation surplus inherited from the prestige of the journals. Our simple method for separating the citation preference of an individual article from the inherited citation of the journals reveals an unexpected regularity in the normalized annual acquisitions of citations across the entire field of science. Specifically, the normalized annual citation acquisitions have power-law probability distributions with an exponential cut-off of the exponents around 2.3, regardless of its publication and citation year. Our results imply that journal reputation has a substantial long-term impact on the citation."

    title "regression for citation data an evaluation of different methods"
    abstract "Citations are increasingly used for research evaluations. It is therefore important to identify factors affecting citation scores that are unrelated to scholarly quality or usefulness so that these can be taken into account. Regression is the most powerful statistical technique to identify these factors and hence it is important to identify the best regression strategy for citation data. Citation counts tend to follow a discrete lognormal distribution and, in the absence of alternatives, have been investigated with negative binomial regression. Using simulated discrete lognormal data (continuous lognormal data rounded to the nearest integer) this article shows that a better strategy is to add one to the citations, take their log and then use the general linear (ordinary least squares) model for regression (e.g., multiple linear regression, ANOVA), or to use the generalised linear model without the log. Reasonable results can also be obtained if all the zero citations are discarded, the log is taken of the remaining citation counts and then the general linear model is used, or if the generalised linear model is used with the continuous lognormal distribution. Similar approaches are recommended for altmetric data, if it proves to be lognormally distributed."

    title "research assessment by percentile based double rank analysis"
    abstract "In the double rank analysis of research publications, the local rank position of a country or institution publication is expressed as a function of the world rank position. Excluding some highly or lowly cited publications, the double rank plot fits well with a power law, which can be explained because citations for local and world publications follow lognormal distributions. We report here that the distribution of the number of country or institution publications in world percentiles is a double rank distribution that can be fitted to a power law. Only the data points in high percentiles deviate from it when the local and world &#956; parameters of the lognormal distributions are very different. The likelihood of publishing very highly cited papers can be calculated from the power law that can be fitted either to the upper tail of the citation distribution or to the percentile-based double rank distribution. The great advantage of the latter method is that it has universal application, because it is based on all publications and not just on highly cited publications. Furthermore, this method extends the application of the well-established percentile approach to very low percentiles where breakthroughs are reported but paper counts cannot be performed."

    title "the discretised lognormal and hooked power law distributions for complete citation data best options for modelling and regression"
    abstract "Identifying the statistical distribution that best fits citation data is important to allow robust and powerful quantitative analyses. Whilst previous studies have suggested that both the hooked power law and discretised lognormal distributions fit better than the power law and negative binomial distributions, no comparisons so far have covered all articles within a discipline, including those that are uncited. Based on an analysis of 26 different Scopus subject areas in seven different years, this article reports comparisons of the discretised lognormal and the hooked power law with citation data, adding 1 to citation counts in order to include zeros. The hooked power law fits better in two thirds of the subject/year combinations tested for journal articles that are at least three years old, including most medical, life and natural sciences, and for virtually all subject areas for younger articles. Conversely, the discretised lognormal tends to fit best for arts, humanities, social science and engineering fields. The difference between the fits of the distributions is mostly small, however, and so either could reasonably be used for modelling citation data. For regression analyses the best option is to use ordinary least squares regression applied to the natural logarithm of citation counts plus one, especially for sets of younger articles, because of the increased precision of the parameters."

    title "power laws in citation distributions evidence from scopus"
    abstract "Modeling distributions of citations to scientific papers is crucial for understanding how science develops. However, there is a considerable empirical controversy on which statistical model fits the citation distributions best. This paper is concerned with rigorous empirical detection of power-law behaviour in the distribution of citations received by the most highly cited scientific papers. We have used a large, novel data set on citations to scientific papers published between 1998 and 2002 drawn from Scopus. The power-law model is compared with a number of alternative models using a likelihood ratio test. We have found that the power-law hypothesis is rejected for around half of the Scopus fields of science. For these fields of science, the Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off and log-normal distributions seem to fit the data better than the pure power-law model. On the other hand, when the power-law hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually empirically indistinguishable from most of the alternative models. The pure power-law model seems to be the best model only for the most highly cited papers in &#34;Physics and Astronomy&#34;. Overall, our results seem to support theories implying that the most highly cited scientific papers follow the Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off or log-normal distribution. Our findings suggest also that power laws in citation distributions, when present, account only for a very small fraction of the published papers (less than 1% for most of science fields) and that the power-law scaling parameter (exponent) is substantially higher (from around 3.2 to around 4.7) than found in the older literature."
