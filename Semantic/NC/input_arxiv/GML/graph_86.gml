    title "on the scaling of interference alignment under delay and power constraints"
    abstract "Future wireless standards such as 5G envision dense wireless networks with large number of simultaneously connected devices. In this context, interference management becomes critical in achieving high spectral efficiency. Orthogonal signaling, which limits the number of users utilizing the resource simultaneously, gives a sum-rate that remains constant with increasing number of users. An alternative approach called interference alignment promises a throughput that scales linearly with the number of users. However, this approach requires very high SNR or long time duration for sufficient channel variation, and therefore may not be feasible in real wireless systems. We explore ways to manage interference in large networks with delay and power constraints. Specifically, we devise an interference phase alignment strategy that combines precoding and scheduling without using power control to exploit the diversity inherent in a system with large number of users. We show that this scheme achieves a sum-rate that scales almost logarithmically with the number of users. We also show that no scheme using single symbol phase alignment, which is asymmetric complex signaling restricted to a single complex symbol, can achieve better than logarithmic scaling of the sum-rate."

    title "gaussian interference channel capacity to within one bit"
    abstract "The capacity of the two-user Gaussian interference channel has been open for thirty years. The understanding on this problem has been limited. The best known achievable region is due to Han-Kobayashi but its characterization is very complicated. It is also not known how tight the existing outer bounds are. In this work, we show that the existing outer bounds can in fact be arbitrarily loose in some parameter ranges, and by deriving new outer bounds, we show that a simplified Han-Kobayashi type scheme can achieve to within a single bit the capacity for all values of the channel parameters. We also show that the scheme is asymptotically optimal at certain high SNR regimes. Using our results, we provide a natural generalization of the point-to-point classical notion of degrees of freedom to interference-limited scenarios."

    title "estimation in phase shift and forward wireless sensor networks"
    abstract "We consider a network of single-antenna sensors that observe an unknown deterministic parameter. Each sensor applies a phase shift to the observation and the sensors simultaneously transmit the result to a multi-antenna fusion center (FC). Based on its knowledge of the wireless channel to the sensors, the FC calculates values for the phase factors that minimize the variance of the parameter estimate, and feeds this information back to the sensors. The use of a phase-shift-only transmission scheme provides a simplified analog implementation at the sensor, and also leads to a simpler algorithm design and performance analysis. We propose two algorithms for this problem, a numerical solution based on a relaxed semidefinite programming problem, and a closed-form solution based on the analytic constant modulus algorithm. Both approaches are shown to provide performance close to the theoretical bound. We derive asymptotic performance analyses for cases involving large numbers of sensors or large numbers of FC antennas, and we also study the impact of phase errors at the sensor transmitters. Finally, we consider the sensor selection problem, in which only a subset of the sensors is chosen to send their observations to the FC."

    title "asymptotic sum capacity of random gaussian interference networks using interference alignment"
    abstract "We consider a dense n-user Gaussian interference network formed by paired transmitters and receivers placed independently at random in Euclidean space. Under natural conditions on the node position distributions and signal attenuation, we prove convergence in probability of the average per-user capacity C_Sigma/n to 1/2 E log(1 + 2SNR). #R##N#The achievability result follows directly from results based on an interference alignment scheme presented in recent work of Nazer et al. Our main contribution comes through the converse result, motivated by ideas of `bottleneck links' developed in recent work of Jafar. An information theoretic argument gives a capacity bound on such bottleneck links, and probabilistic counting arguments show there are sufficiently many such links to tightly bound the sum-capacity of the whole network."

    title "topological interference management through index coding"
    abstract "This paper studies linear interference networks, both wired and wireless, with no channel state information at the transmitters except a coarse knowledge of the end-to-end one-hop topology of the network that only allows a distinction between weak (zero) and significant (nonzero) channels and no further knowledge of the channel coefficients' realizations. The network capacity (wired) and degrees of freedom (DoF) (wireless) are found to be bounded above by the capacity of an index coding problem for which the antidote graph is the complement of the given interference graph. The problems are shown to be equivalent under linear solutions. An interference alignment perspective is then used to translate the existing index coding solutions into the wired network capacity and wireless network DoF solutions, as well as to find new and unified solutions to different classes of all three problems."

    title "on the degrees of freedom achievable through interference alignment in a mimo interference channel"
    abstract "Consider a K-user flat fading MIMO interference channel where the kth transmitter (or receiver) is equipped with Mk (respectively Nk) antennas. If an exponential (in K) number of generic channel extensions are used either across time or frequency, Cadambe and Jafar [1] showed that the total achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) can be maximized via interference alignment, resulting in a total DoF that grows linearly with A even if Mk and Nk are bounded. In this work we consider the case where no channel extension is allowed, and establish a general condition that must be satisfied by any degrees of freedom tuple (d1. d2....dK) achievable through linear interference alignment. For a symmetric system with Mk = M, Nk = N, dk = d for all k, this condition implies that the total achievable DoF cannot grow linearly with K, and is in fact no more than K(M + N)/(K + 1). We also show that this bound is tight when the number of antennas at each transceiver is divisible by d, the number of data streams per user."

    title "on cooperation and interference in the weak interference regime full version with detailed proofs"
    abstract "Handling interference is one of the main challenges in the design of wireless networks. In this paper we study the application of cooperation for interference management in the weak interference (WI) regime, focusing on the Z-interference channel with a causal relay (Z-ICR), when the channel coefficients are subject to ergodic phase fading, all transmission powers are finite, and the relay is full-duplex. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the benefits of cooperation in the WI regime, we characterize, for the first time, two major performance measures for the ergodic phase fading Z-ICR in the WI regime: The sum-rate capacity and the maximal generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In the capacity analysis, we obtain conditions on the channel coefficients, subject to which the sum-rate capacity of the ergodic phase fading Z-ICR is achieved by treating interference as noise at each receiver, and explicitly state the corresponding sum-rate capacity. In the GDoF analysis, we derive conditions on the exponents of the magnitudes of the channel coefficients, under which treating interference as noise achieves the maximal GDoF, which is explicitly characterized as well. It is shown that under certain conditions on the channel coefficients, {\em relaying strictly increases} both the sum-rate capacity and the maximal GDoF of the ergodic phase fading Z-interference channel in the WI regime. Our results demonstrate {\em for the first time} the gains from relaying in the presence of interference, {\em when interference is weak and the relay power is finite}, both in increasing the sum-rate capacity and in increasing the maximal GDoF, compared to the channel without a relay."

    title "generalized degrees of freedom of the symmetric gaussian k user interference channel"
    abstract "We characterize the generalized degrees of freedom of the $K$ user symmetric Gaussian interference channel where all desired links have the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and all undesired links carrying interference have the same interference-to-noise ratio, ${INR}={SNR}^\alpha$. We find that the number of generalized degrees of freedom per user, $d(\alpha)$, does not depend on the number of users, so that the characterization is identical to the 2 user interference channel with the exception of a singularity at $\alpha=1$ where $d(1)=\frac{1}{K}$. The achievable schemes use multilevel coding with a nested lattice structure that opens the possibility that the sum of interfering signals can be decoded at a receiver even though the messages carried by the interfering signals are not decodable."

    title "ergodic interference alignment"
    abstract "This paper develops a new communication strategy, ergodic interference alignment, for the K-user interference channel with time-varying fading. At any particular time, each receiver will see a superposition of the transmitted signals plus noise. The standard approach to such a scenario results in each transmitter-receiver pair achieving a rate proportional to 1/K its interference-free ergodic capacity. However, given two well-chosen time indices, the channel coefficients from interfering users can be made to exactly cancel. By adding up these two observations, each receiver can obtain its desired signal without any interference. If the channel gains have independent, uniform phases, this technique allows each user to achieve at least 1/2 its interference-free ergodic capacity at any signal-to-noise ratio. Prior interference alignment techniques were only able to attain this performance as the signal-to-noise ratio tended to infinity. Extensions are given for the case where each receiver wants a message from more than one transmitter as well as the &#34;X channel&#34; case (with two receivers) where each transmitter has an independent message for each receiver. Finally, it is shown how to generalize this strategy beyond Gaussian channel models. For a class of finite field interference channels, this approach yields the ergodic capacity region."

    title "aiming perfectly in the dark blind interference alignment through staggered antenna switching"
    abstract "We propose a blind interference alignment scheme for the vector broadcast channel where the transmitter is equipped with M antennas and there are K receivers, each equipped with a reconfigurable antenna capable of switching among M preset modes. Without any knowledge of the channel coefficient values at the transmitters and with only mild assumptions on the channel coherence structure we show that MK/M+K-1 degrees of freedom are achievable. The key to the blind interference alignment scheme is the ability of the receivers to switch between reconfigurable antenna modes to create short term channel fluctuation patterns that are exploited by the transmitter. The achievable scheme does not require cooperation between transmit antennas and is therefore applicable to the MxK X network as well. Only finite symbol extensions are used, and no channel knowledge at the receivers is required to null the interference."

    title "on the optimality of treating interference as noise for k user parallel gaussian interference networks"
    abstract "It has been shown recently by Geng et al. that in a $K$ user Gaussian interference network, if for each user the desired signal strength is no less than the sum of the strengths of the strongest interference from this user and the strongest interference to this user (all signal strengths measured in dB scale), then power control and treating interference as noise (TIN) is sufficient to achieve the entire generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region. Motivated by the intuition that the deterministic model of Avestimehr et al. (ADT deterministic model) is particularly suited for exploring the optimality of TIN, the results of Geng et al. are first re-visited under the ADT deterministic model, and are shown to directly translate between the Gaussian and deterministic settings. Next, we focus on the extension of these results to parallel interference networks, from a sum-capacity/sum-GDoF perspective. To this end, we interpret the explicit characterization of the sum-capacity/sum-GDoF of a TIN optimal network (without parallel channels) as a minimum weighted matching problem in combinatorial optimization, and obtain a simple characterization in terms of a partition of the interference network into vertex-disjoint cycles. Aided by insights from the cyclic partition, the sum-capacity optimality of TIN for $K$ user parallel interference networks is characterized for the ADT deterministic model, leading ultimately to corresponding GDoF results for the Gaussian setting. In both cases, subject to a mild invertibility condition the optimality of TIN is shown to extend to parallel networks in a separable fashion."

    title "hierarchical cooperation achieves optimal capacity scaling in ad hoc networks"
    abstract "n source and destination pairs randomly located in an area want to communicate with each other. Signals transmitted from one user to another at distance r apart are subject to a power loss of r^{-alpha}, as well as a random phase. We identify the scaling laws of the information theoretic capacity of the network. In the case of dense networks, where the area is fixed and the density of nodes increasing, we show that the total capacity of the network scales linearly with n. This improves on the best known achievability result of n^{2/3} of Aeron and Saligrama, 2006. In the case of extended networks, where the density of nodes is fixed and the area increasing linearly with n, we show that this capacity scales as n^{2-alpha/2} for 2 3. The best known earlier result (Xie and Kumar 2006) identified the scaling law for alpha > 4. Thus, much better scaling than multihop can be achieved in dense networks, as well as in extended networks with low attenuation. The performance gain is achieved by intelligent node cooperation and distributed MIMO communication. The key ingredient is a hierarchical and digital architecture for nodal exchange of information for realizing the cooperation."

While the problem is originally studied with fixed topology, in this work we explore the implications of varying connectivity, through a series of simple and conceptually representative examples. Specifically, we highlight the synergistic benefits of coding across alternating topologies."

This work contributes to this line of work by investigating the optimal functional split of control and data plane functionalities at the edge nodes and at the Remote Cloud Center (RCC) as a function of the fronthaul latency. The model under study consists of a two-user time-varying uplink channel in which the RCC has global but delayed channel state information (CSI) due to fronthaul latency, while edge nodes have local but timely CSI. Adopting the adaptive sum-rate as the performance criterion, functional splits whereby the control functionality of rate selection and the decoding of the data-plane frames are carried out at either the edge nodes or at the RCC are compared through analysis and numerical results."

In this paper we show that such a separation does not apply to parallel Gaussian interference channels in general. A counter-example is provided in the form of a 3 user interference channel where separate encoding can only achieve a sum capacity of log(SNR) +o(log(SNR)) per carrier while the actual capacity, achieved only by joint-encoding across carriers, is 3/2(log(SNR))+o(log(SNR)) per carrier. As a byproduct of our analysis, we propose a class of multiple-access-outerbounds on the capacity of the 3 user interference channel."

    title "the ergodic capacity of phase fading interference networks"
    abstract "We identify the role of equal strength interference links as bottlenecks on the ergodic sum capacity of a K user phase-fading interference network, i.e., an interference network where the fading process is restricted primarily to independent and uniform phase variations while the channel magnitudes are held fixed across time. It is shown that even though there are K(K-1) cross-links, only about K/2 disjoint and equal strength interference links suffice to determine the capacity of the network regardless of the strengths of the rest of the cross channels. This scenario is called a minimal bottleneck state. It is shown that ergodic interference alignment is capacity optimal for a network in a minimal bottleneck state. The results are applied to large networks. It is shown that large networks are close to bottleneck states with a high probability, so that ergodic interference alignment is close to optimal for large networks. Limitations of the notion of bottleneck states are also highlighted for channels where both the phase and the magnitudes vary with time. It is shown through an example that for these channels, joint coding across different bottleneck states makes it possible to circumvent the capacity bottlenecks."

    abstract "We consider a fading AWGN 2-user 2-hop network in which the channel coefficients are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) drawn from a continuous distribution and vary over time. For a broad class of channel distributions, we characterize the ergodic sum capacity within a constant number of bits/sec/Hz, independent of signal-to-noise ratio. The achievability follows from the analysis of an interference neutralization scheme where the relays are partitioned into K pairs, and interference is neutralized separately by each pair of relays. For K = 1, we previously proved a gap of 4 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and approximately 4.7 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. In this paper, we give a result for general K. In the limit of large K, we characterize the ergodic sum capacity within 4((log &#960;) &#8722; 1) &#8771; 2.6 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and 4(4 &#8722; log3&#960;) &#8771; 3.1 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d.

We provide inner and outer bounds for the $n\times n$-dimensional unicast and the $n\times 2^n$-dimensional multicast capacity regions of such a wireless network. These inner and outer bounds differ only by a factor $O(\log(n))$, yielding a fairly tight scaling characterization of the entire regions. The communication schemes achieving the inner bounds use interference alignment as a central technique and are, at least conceptually, surprisingly simple."

    title "degrees of freedom for mimo two way x relay channel"
    abstract "We study the degrees of freedom (DOF) of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way X relay channel, where there are two groups of source nodes and one relay node, each equipped with multiple antennas, and each of the two source nodes in one group exchanges independent messages with the two source nodes in the other group via the relay node. It is assumed that every source node is equipped with   $M$    antennas while the relay is equipped with    $N$   antennas. We first show that the upper bound on the total DOF for this network is    $2\min\{2M, N\}$   and then focus on the case of   $N\leq 2M$    so that the DOF is upper bounded by twice the number of antennas at the relay. By applying signal alignment for network coding and joint transceiver design for interference cancellation, we show that this upper bound can be achieved when   $N\leq\lfloor{8M\over 5}\rfloor$  . We also show that with signal alignment only but no joint transceiver design, the upper bound is achievable when    $N\leq\lfloor{4M\over 3}\rfloor$  . Simulation results are provided to corroborate the theoretical results and to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in the finite signal-to-noise ratio regime."
