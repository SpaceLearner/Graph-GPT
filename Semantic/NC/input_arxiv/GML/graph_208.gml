    title "adaptive alternating minimization algorithms"
    abstract "The classical alternating minimization (or projection) algorithm has been successful in the context of solving optimization problems over two variables. The iterative nature and simplicity of the algorithm has led to its application to many areas such as signal processing, information theory, control, and finance. A general set of sufficient conditions for the convergence and correctness of the algorithm is quite well-known when the underlying problem parameters are fixed. In many practical situations, however, the underlying problem parameters are changing over time, and the use of an adaptive algorithm is more appropriate. In this paper, we study such an adaptive version of the alternating minimization algorithm. As a main result of this paper, we provide a general set of sufficient conditions for the convergence and correctness of the adaptive algorithm. Perhaps surprisingly, these conditions seem to be the minimal ones one would expect in such an adaptive setting. We present applications of our results to adaptive decomposition of mixtures, adaptive log-optimal portfolio selection, and adaptive filter design."

    title "an efficient adaptive distributed space time coding scheme for cooperative relaying"
    abstract "A non-regenerative dual-hop wireless system based on distributed Alamouti space-time coding is considered. It is assumed that each relay retransmits an appropriately scaled space-time coded version of its received signal. The main goal of this paper is to find a scaling function for each relay to minimize the outage probability. In the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime for the relay-destination link, it is shown that a threshold-based scaling function (i.e., the relay remains silent if its channel gain with the source is less than its predetermined threshold) is optimum from the outage probability point of view. Numerical results demonstrate a dramatic performance improvement as compared to the case that the relay stations forward their received signals with full power even for finite SNR scenarios."

    title "iterative detection and decoding algorithms for mimo systems in block fading channels using ldpc codes"
    abstract "We propose iterative detection and decoding (IDD) algorithms with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in block-fading and fast Rayleigh fading channels. Soft-input&#8211;soft-output minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) receivers with successive interference cancelation are considered. In particular, we devise a novel strategy to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of IDD schemes, which takes into account the soft   a posteriori   output of the decoder in a block-fading channel when root-check LDPC codes are used. A MIMO IDD receiver with soft information processing that exploits the code structure and the behavior of the log-likelihood ratios is also developed. Moreover, we present a scheduling algorithm for decoding LDPC codes in block-fading channels. Simulations show that the proposed techniques result in significant gains in terms of BER for both block-fading and fast-fading channels."

We develop relay selection algorithms to improve the secrecy-rate performance of cooperative multi-user multiple-antenna wireless networks. In particular, we propose a novel finite buffer-aided relay selection algorithm that employs the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion to select sets of relays which fully exploit the flexibility offered by relay nodes equipped with buffers.

    title "optimal space time codes for the mimo amplify and forward cooperative channel"
    abstract "In this work, we extend the non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) cooperative diversity scheme to the MIMO channel. A family of space-time block codes for a half-duplex MIMO NAF fading cooperative channel with N relays is constructed. The code construction is based on the non-vanishing determinant criterion (NVD) and is shown to achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the channel. We provide a general explicit algebraic construction, followed by some examples. In particular, in the single relay case, it is proved that the Golden code and the 4x4 Perfect code are optimal for the single-antenna and two-antenna case, respectively. Simulation results reveal that a significant gain (up to 10dB) can be obtained with the proposed codes, especially in the single-antenna case."

    title "adaptive power allocation strategies using dstc in cooperative mimo networks"
    abstract "Adaptive Power Allocation (PA) algorithms with different criteria for a cooperative Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) network equipped with Distributed Space-Time Coding (DSTC) are proposed and evaluated. Joint constrained optimization algorithms to determine the power allocation parameters, the channel parameters and the receive filter are proposed for each transmitted stream in each link. Linear receive filter and maximum-likelihood (ML) detection are considered with Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and Decode-and-Forward (DF) cooperation strategies. In the proposed algorithms, the elements in the PA matrices are optimized at the destination node and then transmitted back to the relay nodes via a feedback channel. The effects of the feedback errors are considered. Linear MMSE expressions and the PA matrices depend on each other and are updated iteratively. Stochastic gradient (SG) algorithms are developed with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant performance gains as compared to existing power allocation schemes."

A maximum likelihood receiver and adjustable code vectors are considered subject to a power constraint with an amplify-and-forward cooperation strategy. Each multiple-antenna relay is equipped with a buffer and is capable of storing the received symbols before forwarding them to the destination. We also present an adaptive relay selection and optimization algorithm, in which the instantaneous signal to noise ratio in each link is calculated and compared at the destination. An adjustable code vector obtained by a feedback channel at each relay is employed to form a space-time coded vector which achieves a higher coding gain than standard schemes. A stochastic gradient algorithm is developed to compute the parameters of the adjustable code vector with reduced computational complexity.

    title "robust adaptive beamforming based on low rank and cross correlation techniques"
    abstract "This paper presents cost-effective low-rank techniques for designing robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) algorithms. The proposed algorithms are based on the exploitation of the cross-correlation between the array observation data and the output of the beamformer. First, we construct a general linear equation considered in large dimensions whose solution yields the steering vector mismatch. Then, we employ the idea of the full orthogonalization method (FOM), an orthogonal Krylov subspace based method, to iteratively estimate the steering vector mismatch in a reduced-dimensional subspace, resulting in the proposed orthogonal Krylov subspace projection mismatch estimation (OKSPME) method. We also devise adaptive algorithms based on stochastic gradient (SG) and conjugate gradient (CG) techniques to update the beamforming weights with low complexity and avoid any costly matrix inversion. The main advantages of the proposed low-rank and mismatch estimation techniques are their cost-effectiveness when dealing with high-dimension subspaces or large sensor arrays. Simulations results show excellent performance in terms of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the beamformer among all the compared RAB methods."

    title "adaptive distributed space time coding based on adjustable code matrices for cooperative mimo relaying systems"
    abstract "An adaptive distributed space-time coding (DSTC) scheme is proposed for two-hop cooperative MIMO networks. Linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive filters and adjustable code matrices are considered subject to a power constraint with an amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation strategy. In the proposed adaptive DSTC scheme, an adjustable code matrix obtained by a feedback channel is employed to transform the space-time coded matrix at the relay node. The effects of the limited feedback and the feedback errors are assessed. Linear MMSE expressions are devised to compute the parameters of the adjustable code matrix and the linear receive filters. Stochastic gradient (SG) and least-squares (LS) algorithms are also developed with reduced computational complexity. An upper bound on the pairwise error probability analysis is derived and indicates the advantage of employing the adjustable code matrices at the relay nodes. An alternative optimization algorithm for the adaptive DSTC scheme is also derived in order to eliminate the need for the feedback. The algorithm provides a fully distributed scheme for the adaptive DSTC at the relay node based on the minimization of the error probability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant performance gains as compared to existing DSTC schemes."

In comparison with existing centralized or distributed estimation strategies, key features of the proposed algorithms are: 1) more accurate estimates and faster convergence speed can be obtained; 2) the design of preconditioners for CG algorithms, which have the ability to improve the performance of the proposed CG algorithms is presented and 3) the proposed algorithms are implemented in the area of distributed parameter estimation and spectrum estimation. The performance of the proposed algorithms for distributed estimation is illustrated via simulations and the resulting algorithms are distributed, cooperative and able to respond in real time to change in the environment."

    title "robust mmse precoding for multiuser mimo relay systems using switched relaying and side information"
    abstract "This study proposes a novel precoding scheme for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). The base station (BS) and the MIMO relay station (RS) are both equipped with the same codebook of unitary matrices. According to each element of the codebook, we create a latent precoding matrix pair, namely a BS precoding matrix and an RS precoding matrix. The RS precoding matrix is formed by multiplying the appropriate unitary matrix from the codebook by a power scaling factor. Based on the given CSI and a block of transmit symbols, the optimum precoding matrix pair, within the class of all possible latent precoding matrix pairs derived from the various unitary matrices, is selected by a suitable selection mechanism for transmission, which is designed to minimize the squared Euclidean distance between the pre-estimated received vector and the true transmit symbol vector. We develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE) design algorithm for the construction of the latent precoding matrix pairs. In the proposed scheme, rather than sending the complete processing matrix, only the index of the unitary matrix and its power scaling factor are sent by the BS to the RS. This significantly reduces the overhead. Simulation results show that compared to other recently reported precoding algorithms the proposed precoding scheme is capable of providing improved robustness against the effects of CSI estimation errors and multiuser interference."

    title "study of opportunistic cooperation techniques using jamming and relays for physical layer security in buffer aided relay networks"
    abstract "In this paper, we investigate opportunistic relay and jammer cooperation schemes in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) buffer-aided relay networks. The network consists of one source, an arbitrary number of relay nodes, legitimate users and eavesdroppers, with the constraints of physical layer security. We propose an algorithm to select a set of relay nodes to enhance the legitimate users' transmission and another set of relay nodes to perform jamming of the eavesdroppers. With Inter-Relay interference (IRI) taken into account, interference cancellation can be implemented to assist the transmission of the legitimate users. Secondly, IRI can also be used to further increase the level of harm of the jamming signal to the eavesdroppers. By exploiting the fact that the jamming signal can be stored at the relay nodes, we also propose a hybrid algorithm to set a signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) threshold at the node to determine the type of signal stored at the relay node. With this separation, the signals with high SINR are delivered to the users as conventional relay systems and the low SINR performance signals are stored as potential jamming signals. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques obtain a significant improvement in secrecy rate over previously reported algorithms."

    title "decoupled signal detection for the uplink of large scale mimo systems in heterogeneous networks"
    abstract "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are strong candidates for future fifth generation (5G) heterogeneous cellular networks. For 5G, a network densification with a high number of different classes of users and data service requirements is expected. Such a large number of connected devices needs to be separated in order to allow the detection of the transmitted signals according to different data requirements. In this paper, a decoupled signal detection (DSD) technique which allows the separation of the uplink signals, for each user class, at the base station (BS) is proposed for massive MIMO systems. A mathematical signal model for massive MIMO systems with centralized and distributed antennas in heterogeneous networks is also developed. The performance of the proposed DSD algorithm is evaluated and compared with existing detection schemes in a realistic scenario with distributed antennas. A sum-rate analysis and a computational cost study for DSD are also presented. Simulation results show an excellent performance of the proposed DSD algorithm when combined with linear and successive interference cancellation detection techniques."

The perform of THP, however, is restricted by the dimensionality constraint that the number of transmit antennas has to be greater or equal to the total number of receive antennas. In this paper, we propose an iterative coordinate THP algorithm for the scenarios in which the total number of receive antennas is larger than the number of transmit antennas. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two types of THP structures, the decentralized THP (dTHP) with diagonal weighted filters at the receivers of the users, and the centralized THP (cTHP) with diagonal weighted filter at the transmitter. Simulation results show that a much better bit error rate (BER) and sum-rate performances can be achieved by the proposed iterative coordinate THP compared to the previous linear art."
