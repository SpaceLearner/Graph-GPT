    title "the pin bang theory discovering the pinterest world"
    abstract "Pinterest is an image-based online social network, which was launched in the year 2010 and has gained a lot of traction, ever since. Within 3 years, Pinterest has attained 48.7 million unique users. This stupendous growth makes it interesting to study Pinterest, and gives rise to multiple questions about it's users, and content. We characterized Pinterest on the basis of large scale crawls of 3.3 million user profiles, and 58.8 million pins. In particular, we explored various attributes of users, pins, boards, pin sources, and user locations, in detail and performed topical analysis of user generated textual content. The characterization revealed most prominent topics among users and pins, top image sources, and geographical distribution of users on Pinterest. We then investigated this social network from a privacy and security standpoint, and found traces of malware in the form of pin sources. Instances of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage were also discovered in the form of phone numbers, BBM (Blackberry Messenger) pins, and email addresses. Further, our analysis demonstrated how Pinterest is a potential venue for copyright infringement, by showing that almost half of the images shared on Pinterest go uncredited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to characterize Pinterest at such a large scale."

    title "four degrees of separation"
    abstract "Frigyes Karinthy, in his 1929 short story &#34;L\'aancszemek&#34; (&#34;Chains&#34;) suggested that any two persons are distanced by at most six friendship links. (The exact wording of the story is slightly ambiguous: &#34;He bet us that, using no more than five individuals, one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual [...]&#34;. It is not completely clear whether the selected individual is part of the five, so this could actually allude to distance five or six in the language of graph theory, but the &#34;six degrees of separation&#34; phrase stuck after John Guare's 1990 eponymous play. Following Milgram's definition and Guare's interpretation, we will assume that &#34;degrees of separation&#34; is the same as &#34;distance minus one&#34;, where &#34;distance&#34; is the usual path length-the number of arcs in the path.) Stanley Milgram in his famous experiment challenged people to route postcards to a fixed recipient by passing them only through direct acquaintances. The average number of intermediaries on the path of the postcards lay between 4.4 and 5.7, depending on the sample of people chosen. #R##N#We report the results of the first world-scale social-network graph-distance computations, using the entire Facebook network of active users (\approx721 million users, \approx69 billion friendship links). The average distance we observe is 4.74, corresponding to 3.74 intermediaries or &#34;degrees of separation&#34;, showing that the world is even smaller than we expected, and prompting the title of this paper. More generally, we study the distance distribution of Facebook and of some interesting geographic subgraphs, looking also at their evolution over time. #R##N#The networks we are able to explore are almost two orders of magnitude larger than those analysed in the previous literature. We report detailed statistical metadata showing that our measurements (which rely on probabilistic algorithms) are very accurate."

    title "learning resolution parameters for graph clustering"
    abstract "Finding clusters of well-connected nodes in a graph is an extensively studied problem in graph-based data analysis. Because of its many applications, a large number of distinct graph clustering objective functions and algorithms have already been proposed and analyzed. To aid practitioners in determining the best clustering approach to use in different applications, we present new techniques for automatically learning how to set clustering resolution parameters. These parameters control the size and structure of communities that are formed by optimizing a generalized objective function. We begin by formalizing the notion of a parameter fitness function, which measures how well a fixed input clustering approximately solves a generalized clustering objective for a specific resolution parameter value. Under reasonable assumptions, which suit two key graph clustering applications, such a parameter fitness function can be efficiently minimized using a bisection-like method, yielding a resolution parameter that fits well with the example clustering. We view our framework as a type of single-shot hyperparameter tuning, as we are able to learn a good resolution parameter with just a single example. Our general approach can be applied to learn resolution parameters for both local and global graph clustering objectives. We demonstrate its utility in several experiments on real-world data where it is helpful to learn resolution parameters from a given example clustering."

    title "enforcing transparent access to private content in social networks by means of automatic sanitization"
    abstract "A system to enforce privacy protection in existing social networks.An automatic method to assess the privacy risks of users' publications.A transparent data storage and accessing mechanism according to users' credentials.Feasibility study and two illustrative case studies in PatientsLikeMe and Twitter. Social networks have become an essential meeting point for millions of individuals willing to publish and consume huge quantities of heterogeneous information. Some studies have shown that the data published in these platforms may contain sensitive personal information and that external entities can gather and exploit this knowledge for their own benefit. Even though some methods to preserve the privacy of social networks users have been proposed, they generally apply rigid access control measures to the protected content and, even worse, they do not enable the users to understand which contents are sensitive. Last but not least, most of them require the collaboration of social network operators or they fail to provide a practical solution capable of working with well-known and already deployed social platforms (e.g., Twitter). In this paper, we propose a new scheme that addresses all these issues. The new system is envisaged as an independent piece of software that does not depend on the social network in use and that can be transparently applied to most existing ones. According to a set of privacy requirements intuitively defined by the users of a social network, the proposed scheme is able to: (i) automatically detect sensitive data in users' publications; (ii) construct sanitized versions of such data; and (iii) provide privacy-preserving transparent access to sensitive contents by disclosing more or less information to readers according to their credentials toward the owner of the publications. We also study the applicability of the proposed system in general and illustrate its behavior in two well-known social networks (i.e., Twitter and PatientsLikeMe)."

    title "friendship networks and social status"
    abstract "In empirical studies of friendship networks, participants are typically asked, in interviews or questionnaires, to identify some or all of their close friends, resulting in a directed network in which friendships can, and often do, run in only one direction between a pair of individuals. Here we analyze a large collection of such networks representing friendships among students at US high and junior-high schools and show that the pattern of unreciprocated friendships is far from random. In every network, without exception, we find that there exists a ranking of participants, from low to high, such that almost all unreciprocated friendships consist of a lower ranked individual claiming friendship with a higher ranked one. We present a maximum-likelihood method for deducing such rankings from observed network data and conjecture that the rankings produced reflect a measure of social status. We note in particular that reciprocated and unreciprocated friendships obey different statistics, suggesting different formation processes, and that rankings are correlated with other characteristics of the participants that are traditionally associated with status, such as age and overall popularity as measured by total number of friends."

    title "social resilience in online communities the autopsy of friendster"
    abstract "We empirically analyze five online communities: Friendster, Livejournal, Facebook, Orkut, and Myspace, to study how social networks decline. We define social resilience as the ability of a community to withstand changes. We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but concentrate on their impact. Changes may cause users to leave, which may trigger further leaves of others who lost connection to their friends. This may lead to cascades of users leaving. A social network is said to be resilient if the size of such cascades can be limited. To quantify resilience, we use the k-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network in which all users have at least k friends. These connections generate benefits (b) for each user, which have to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the network. If this difference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the remaining network is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit (c/b) ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to calculate the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to infer the impact of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online communities. We find that the different online communities have different k-core distributions. Consequently, similar changes in the c/b ratio have a different impact on the amount of active users. Further, our resilience analysis shows that the topology of a social network alone cannot explain its success of failure. As a case study, we focus on the evolution of Friendster. We identify time periods when new users entering the network observed an insufficient c/b ratio. This measure can be seen as a precursor of the later collapse of the community. Our analysis can be applied to estimate the impact of changes in the user interface, which may temporarily increase the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community to shrink, or even to collapse."

    title "network weirdness exploring the origins of network paradoxes"
    abstract "Social networks have many counter-intuitive properties, including the &#34;friendship paradox&#34; that states, on average, your friends have more friends than you do. Recently, a variety of other paradoxes were demonstrated in online social networks. This paper explores the origins of these network paradoxes. Specifically, we ask whether they arise from mathematical properties of the networks or whether they have a behavioral origin. We show that sampling from heavy-tailed distributions always gives rise to a paradox in the mean, but not the median. We propose a strong form of network paradoxes, based on utilizing the median, and validate it empirically using data from two online social networks. Specifically, we show that for any user the majority of user's friends and followers have more friends, followers, etc. than the user, and that this cannot be explained by statistical properties of sampling. Next, we explore the behavioral origins of the paradoxes by using the shuffle test to remove correlations between node degrees and attributes. We find that paradoxes for the mean persist in the shuffled network, but not for the median. We demonstrate that strong paradoxes arise due to the assortativity of user attributes, including degree, and correlation between degree and attribute."

    title "social structure of facebook networks"
    abstract "We study the social structure of Facebook &#8220;friendship&#8221; networks at one hundred American colleges and universities at a single point in time, and we examine the roles of user attributes&#8211;gender, class year, major, high school, and residence&#8211;at these institutions. We investigate the influence of common attributes at the dyad level in terms of assortativity coefficients and regression models. We then examine larger-scale groupings by detecting communities algorithmically and comparing them to network partitions based on user characteristics. We thereby examine the relative importance of different characteristics at different institutions, finding for example that common high school is more important to the social organization of large institutions and that the importance of common major varies significantly between institutions. Our calculations illustrate how microscopic and macroscopic perspectives give complementary insights on the social organization at universities and suggest future studies to investigate such phenomena further."

    title "assembling thefacebook using heterogeneity to understand online social network assembly"
    abstract "Online social networks represent a popular and diverse class of social media systems. Despite this variety, each of these systems undergoes a general process of online social network assembly, which represents the complicated and heterogeneous changes that transform newly born systems into mature platforms. However, little is known about this process. For example, how much of a network's assembly is driven by simple growth? How does a network's structure change as it matures? How does network structure vary with adoption rates and user heterogeneity, and do these properties play different roles at different points in the assembly? We investigate these and other questions using a unique dataset of online connections among the roughly one million users at the first 100 colleges admitted to Facebook, captured just 20 months after its launch. We first show that different vintages and adoption rates across this population of networks reveal temporal dynamics of the assembly process, and that assembly is only loosely related to network growth. We then exploit natural experiments embedded in this dataset and complementary data obtained via Internet archaeology to show that different subnetworks matured at different rates toward similar end states. These results shed light on the processes and patterns of online social network assembly, and may facilitate more effective design for online social systems."

    title "parallel algorithms for counting triangles in networks with large degrees"
    abstract "Finding the number of triangles in a network is an important problem in the analysis of complex networks. The number of triangles also has important applications in data mining. Existing distributed memory parallel algorithms for counting triangles are either Map-Reduce based or message passing interface (MPI) based and work with overlapping partitions of the given network. These algorithms are designed for very sparse networks and do not work well when the degrees of the nodes are relatively larger. For networks with larger degrees, Map-Reduce based algorithm generates prohibitively large intermediate data, and in MPI based algorithms with overlapping partitions, each partition can grow as large as the original network, wiping out the benefit of partitioning the network. #R##N#In this paper, we present two efficient MPI-based parallel algorithms for counting triangles in massive networks with large degrees. The first algorithm is a space-efficient algorithm for networks that do not fit in the main memory of a single compute node. This algorithm divides the network into non-overlapping partitions. The second algorithm is for the case where the main memory of each node is large enough to contain the entire network. We observe that for such a case, computation load can be balanced dynamically and present a dynamic load balancing scheme which improves the performance significantly. Both of our algorithms scale well to large networks and to a large number of processors."

    title "assembly in populations of social networks"
    abstract "In-depth studies of sociotechnical systems are largely limited to single instances. Network surveys are expensive, and platforms vary in important ways, from interface design, to social norms, to historical contingencies. With single examples, we can not in general know how much of observed network structure is explained by historical accidents, random noise, or meaningful social processes, nor can we claim that network structure predicts outcomes, such as organization success or ecosystem health. Here, I show how we can adopt a comparative approach for settings where we have, or can cleverly construct, multiple instances of a network to estimate the natural variability in social systems. The comparative approach makes previously untested theories testable. Drawing on examples from the social networks literature, I discuss emerging directions in the study of populations of sociotechnical systems using insights from organization theory and ecology."

This work reports our quantitative assessment of so-called strength of weak ties theory, foreseen by Granovetter&#8217;s seminal studies, applied to well-known Facebook social graph.

    abstract "In this paper we study how the network of agents adopting a particular technology relates to the structure of the underlying network over which the technology adoption spreads. We develop a model and show that the network of agents adopting a particular technology may have characteristics that differ significantly from the social network of agents over which the technology spreads. For example, the network induced by a cascade may have a heavy-tailed degree distribution even if the original network does not. #R##N#This provides evidence that online social networks created by technology adoption over an underlying social network may look fundamentally different from social networks and indicates that using data from many online social networks may mislead us if we try to use it to directly infer the structure of social networks. Our results provide an alternate explanation for certain properties repeatedly observed in data sets, for example: heavy-tailed degree distribution, network densification, shrinking diameter, and network community profile. These properties could be caused by a sort of `sampling bias' rather than by attributes of the underlying social structure. By generating networks using cascades over traditional network models that do not themselves contain these properties, we can nevertheless reliably produce networks that contain all these properties. #R##N#An opportunity for interesting future research is developing new methods that correctly infer underlying network structure from data about a network that is generated via a cascade spread over the underlying network."

    abstract "This paper presents MyZone, a private online social network for relatively small, closely-knit communities. MyZone has three important distinguishing features. First, users keep the ownership of their data and have complete control over maintaining their privacy. Second, MyZone is free from any possibility of content censorship and is highly resilient to any single point of disconnection. Finally, MyZone minimizes deployment cost by minimizing its computation, storage and network bandwidth requirements. It incorporates both a P2P architecture and a centralized architecture in its design ensuring high availability, security and privacy. A prototype of MyZone was deployed over a period of 40 days with a membership of more than one hundred users. The paper provides a detailed evaluation of the results obtained from this deployment."

We compute numerous features of the graph including the number of users and friendships, the degree distribution, path lengths, clustering, and mixing patterns. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the graph, determining that the social network is nearly fully connected, with 99.91% of individuals belonging to a single large connected component, and we confirm the &#34;six degrees of separation&#34; phenomenon on a global scale. Second, by studying the average local clustering coefficient and degeneracy of graph neighborhoods, we show that while the Facebook graph as a whole is clearly sparse, the graph neighborhoods of users contain surprisingly dense structure. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns present in the graph by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity and characterize the extent to which &#34;your friends have more friends than you&#34;. Furthermore, we observe a strong effect of age on friendship preferences as well as a globally modular community structure driven by nationality, but we do not find any strong gender homophily. We compare our results with those from smaller social networks and find mostly, but not entirely, agreement on common structural network characteristics."

Statistical implications of varying individual attentions are investigated and it is argued that this is one reason why the mean of friends is higher than the median in social networks. The distribution of friends skews to the right for two other reasons: (i) the presence of institutional nodes that increase the mean; and (ii) the dormancy of many of the nodes. The difference between friends and friends of friends is a measure of the structural information about the network."

    abstract "We analyze how the sparsity of a typical aggregate social relation impacts the network overhead of online communication systems designed to provide k-anonymity. Once users are grouped in anonymity sets there will likely be few related pairs of users between any two particular sets, and so the sets need to be large in order to provide cover traffic between them. We can reduce the associated overhead by having both parties in a communication specify both the origin and the target sets of the communication. We propose to call this communication primitive &#34;symmetric disclosure.&#34; If in order to retrieve messages a user specifies a group from which he expects to receive them, the negative impact of the sparsity is offset."

    abstract "Networks are a fundamental tool for modeling complex systems in a variety of domains including social and communication networks as well as biology and neuroscience. The counts of small subgraph patterns in networks, called network motifs, are crucial to understanding the structure and function of these systems. However, the role of network motifs for temporal networks, which contain many timestamped links between nodes, is not well understood.   Here we develop a notion of a temporal network motif as an elementary unit of temporal networks and provide a general methodology for counting such motifs. We define temporal network motifs as induced subgraphs on sequences of edges, design several fast algorithms for counting temporal network motifs, and prove their runtime complexity. We also show that our fast algorithms achieve 1.3x to 56.5x speedups compared to a baseline method.   We use our algorithms to count temporal network motifs in a variety of real-world datasets. Results show that networks from different domains have significantly different motif frequencies, whereas networks from the same domain tend to have similar motif frequencies. We also find that measuring motif counts at various time scales reveals different behavior."

    abstract "In China, 260 million people migrate to cities to realize their urban dreams. Despite that these migrants play an important role in the rapid urbanization process, many of them fail to settle down and eventually leave the city. The integration process of migrants thus raises an important issue for scholars and policymakers. #R##N#In this paper, we use Shanghai as an example to investigate migrants' behavior in their first weeks and in particular, how their behavior relates to early departure. Our dataset consists of a one-month complete dataset of 698 telecommunication logs between 54 million users, plus a novel and publicly available housing price data for 18K real estates in Shanghai. We find that migrants who end up leaving early tend to neither develop diverse connections in their first weeks nor move around the city. Their active areas also have higher housing prices than that of staying migrants. We formulate a churn prediction problem to determine whether a migrant is going to leave based on her behavior in the first few days. The prediction performance improves as we include data from more days. Interestingly, when using the same features, the classifier trained from only the first few days is already as good as the classifier trained using full data, suggesting that the performance difference mainly lies in the difference between features."

In this paper, we focus on the population of Mexican mobile phone users. We first present an observational study of mobile phone usage according to gender and age groups. We are able to detect significant differences in phone usage among different subgroups of the population. We then study the performance of different machine learning (ML) methods to predict demographic features (namely, age and gender) of unlabeled users by leveraging individual calling patterns, as well as the structure of the communication graph. We show how a specific implementation of a diffusion model, harnessing the graph structure, has significantly better performance over other node-based standard ML methods. We provide details of the methodology together with an analysis of the robustness of our results to changes in the model parameters. Furthermore, by carefully examining the topological relations of the training nodes (seed nodes) to the rest of the nodes in the network, we find topological metrics which have a direct influence on the performance of the algorithm."
