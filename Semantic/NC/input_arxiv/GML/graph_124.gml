    title "deployment optimization of iot devices through attack graph analysis"
    abstract "The Internet of things (IoT) has become an integral part of our life at both work and home. However, these IoT devices are prone to vulnerability exploits due to their low cost, low resources, the diversity of vendors, and proprietary firmware. Moreover, short range communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth or ZigBee) open additional opportunities for the lateral movement of an attacker within an organization. Thus, the type and location of IoT devices may significantly change the level of network security of the organizational network. In this paper, we quantify the level of network security based on an augmented attack graph analysis that accounts for the physical location of IoT devices and their communication capabilities. We use the depth-first branch and bound (DFBnB) heuristic search algorithm to solve two optimization problems: Full Deployment with Minimal Risk (FDMR) and Maximal Utility without Risk Deterioration (MURD). An admissible heuristic is proposed to accelerate the search. The proposed method is evaluated using a real network with simulated deployment of IoT devices. The results demonstrate (1) the contribution of the augmented attack graphs to quantifying the impact of IoT devices deployed within the organization on security, and (2) the effectiveness of the optimized IoT deployment."

    title "distill net application specific distillation of deep convolutional neural networks for resource constrained iot platforms"
    abstract "Many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications demand fast and accurate understanding of a few key events in their surrounding environment. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as an effective approach to understand speech, images, and similar high dimensional data types. Algorithmic performance of modern CNNs, however, fundamentally relies on learning class-agnostic hierarchical features that only exist in comprehensive training datasets with many classes. As a result, fast inference using CNNs trained on such datasets is prohibitive for most resource-constrained IoT platforms. To bridge this gap, we present a principled and practical methodology for distilling a complex modern CNN that is trained to effectively recognize many different classes of input data into an application-dependent essential core that not only recognizes the few classes of interest to the application accurately, but also runs efficiently on platforms with limited resources. Experimental results confirm that our approach strikes a favorable balance between classification accuracy (application constraint), inference efficiency (platform constraint), and productive development of new applications (business constraint)."

    title "service oriented architecture in industrial automation systems the case of iec 61499 a review"
    abstract "In the paper by W. Dai et al. (IEEE Trans. On Industrial Informatics, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 771-781, June 2015), a formal model is described for the application of SOA in the distributed automation domain in order to achieve flexible automation systems. A service-based execution environment architecture based on the IEC 61499 Function Block model is proposed and a case study is used to demonstrate dynamic reconfiguration. In this letter, a review of the literature related to the use of SOA in Industrial Automation Systems is given to set up a context for the discussion of the proposed in the above paper SOA IEC61499 formal model. The presented, in the above paper, formal model and execution environment architecture are commented towards a better understanding of the potentials for the exploitation of the SOA paradigm in the industrial automation domain."

    title "a framework for the implementation of industrial automation systems based on plcs"
    abstract "Industrial automation systems (IASs) are traditionally developed using a sequential approach where the automation software, which is commonly based on the IEC 61131 languages, is developed when the design and in many cases the implementation of mechanical parts have been completed. However, it is claimed that this approach does not lead to the optimal system design and that the IEC 61131 does not meet new challenges in this domain. In this paper, a system engineering process based on the new version of IEC 61131, which supports Object Orientation, is presented. SysML and UML are utilized to introduce a higher layer of abstraction in the design space of IAS and Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as an enabling technology for the integration of Cyber and Cyber-physical components of the system, bringing into the industrial automation domain the benefits of these technologies."

    abstract "The IEC 61131 standard has been widely#R##N#accepted in the industrial automation domain. However, it is claimed that the#R##N#standard does not address today the new requirements of complex industrial#R##N#systems, which include among others, portability, interoperability, increased#R##N#reusability and distribution. To address these restrictions, the IEC has#R##N#initiated the task of developing the IEC 61499, which is presented as a mature#R##N#technology to enable intelligent automation in various domains. This standard#R##N#was not accepted by industry even though it is highly promoted by the academic#R##N#community. In this paper, it is argued that IEC 61499 has been promoted by#R##N#academy based on unsubstantiated claims on its main features, i.e., reusability, portability, interoperability, event-driven#R##N#execution. A number of misperceptions are presented and discussed in this paper#R##N#to show that the comparison, which appears in the literature, between IEC 61499#R##N#and 61131 is not substantiated."

    title "cyber physical microservices an iot based framework for manufacturing systems"
    abstract "Recent advances in ICT enable the evolution of the manufacturing industry to meet the new requirements of the society. Cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Cloud computing, play a key role in the fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0. The microservice architecture has evolved as an alternative to SOA and promises to address many of the challenges in software development. In this paper, we adopt the concept of microservice and describe a framework for manufacturing systems that has the cyber-physical microservice as the key construct. The manufacturing plant processes are defined as orchestrations of primitive cyber-physical microservices performed by the physical plant layer. Model-driven engineering is utilized to semi-automate the development process for the industrial engineer, who is not familiar with microservices; IoT technologies are used for their integration. A case study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach."

    title "internet of things aided smart grid technologies architectures applications prototypes and future research directions"
    abstract "Traditional power grids are being transformed into Smart Grids (SGs) to address the issues in existing power system due to uni-directional information flow, energy wastage, growing energy demand, reliability and security. SGs offer bi-directional energy flow between service providers and consumers, involving power generation, transmission, distribution and utilization systems. SGs employ various devices for the monitoring, analysis and control of the grid, deployed at power plants, distribution centers and in consumers' premises in a very large number. Hence, an SG requires connectivity, automation and the tracking of such devices. This is achieved with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT helps SG systems to support various network functions throughout the generation, transmission, distribution and consumption of energy by incorporating IoT devices (such as sensors, actuators and smart meters), as well as by providing the connectivity, automation and tracking for such devices. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on IoT-aided SG systems, which includes the existing architectures, applications and prototypes of IoT-aided SG systems. This survey also highlights the open issues, challenges and future research directions for IoT-aided SG systems."

    title "a cyber physical system based approach for industrial automation systems"
    abstract "Industrial automation systems (IASs) are commonly developed using the languages defined by the IEC 61131 standard and are executed on PLCs. In this paper, a system-based approach for the development of IASs is adopted. A framework is described to refine the UML model of the software part, which is extracted from the SysML system model, and get the implementation code. Two implementation alternatives are considered to exploit PLCs but also the recent deluge of embedded boards in the market. For PLC targets, the new version of IEC 61131 that supports Object-Orientation is adopted, while Java is used for embedded boards. The case study was developed as a lab exercise for teaching the various technologies that address challenges in the domain of cyber-physical systems where Internet of Things (IoT) would be the glue regarding their cyber interfaces."

    title "applying chatbots to the internet of things opportunities and architectural elements"
    abstract "Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a significant technology in shaping the future by connecting physical devices or things with the web. It also presents various opportunities for the intersection of other technological trends which can allow it to become even more intelligent and efficient. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Intelligent Conversational Software Agents or Chatbots with IoT. Prior literature has covered various applications, features, underlying technologies and known challenges of IoT. On the other hand, Chatbots are a relatively new concept, being widely adopted due to significant progress in the development of platforms and frameworks.  The novelty of this paper lies in the specific integration of Chatbots in the IoT scenario. We analyzed the shortcomings of existing IoT systems and put forward ways to tackle them by incorporating chatbots. A general architecture is proposed for implementing such a system, as well as platforms and frameworks &#8211; both commercial and open source &#8211; which allow for the implementation of such systems. Identification of the newer challenges and possible future research directions with this new integration have also been addressed."

    title "the perfect storm the privacy paradox and the internet of things"
    abstract "Privacy is a concept found throughout human history and opinion polls suggest that the public value this principle. However, while many individuals claim to care about privacy, they are often perceived to express behaviour to the contrary. This phenomenon is known as the Privacy Paradox and its existence has been validated through numerous psychological, economic and computer science studies. Several contributory factors have been suggested including user interface design, risk salience, social norms and default configurations. We posit that the further proliferation of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) will aggravate many of these factors, posing even greater risks to individuals' privacy. This paper explores the evolution of both the paradox and the IoT, discusses how privacy risk might alter over the coming years, and suggests further research required to address a reasonable balance. We believe both technological and socio-technical measures are necessary to ensure privacy is protected in a world of ubiquitous technology."

The paper presents a new model that includes a design process with new risk assessment vectors, specific for IoT cyber risk. To design new risk assessment vectors for IoT, the study applied a range of methodologies, including literature review, empirical study and comparative study, followed by theoretical analysis and grounded theory. An epistemological framework emerges from applying the constructivist grounded theory methodology to draw on knowledge from existing cyber risk frameworks, models and methodologies. This framework presents the current gaps in cyber risk standards and policies, and defines the design principles of future cyber risk impact assessment. The core contribution of the article therefore, being the presentation of a new model for impact assessment of IoT cyber risk."

    title "an open distributed architecture for flexible hybrid assembly systems a model driven engineering approach"
    abstract "Assembly systems constitute one of the most important fields in today industry. In this paper we propose an open distributed architecture for the engineering of evolvable flexible hybrid assembly systems. The proposed architecture is based on the model driven development paradigm. Models are used to represent structure and behavior and a domain specific engineering tool is defined to facilitate the assembly system engineer in the engineering process of the assembly system. Specific meta models are defined to capture domain knowledge to guide the engineer in the construction of the models required to construct the assembly system. This work is a specialization of our previous work that defined a SOA based framework for embedded industrial automation systems. It adapts and extends, in the assembly systems domain, the 3+1 SysML-view model architecture defined for the engineering of mechatronics Manufacturing systems. The proposed architecture can be used to develop a framework for evolvable flexible and reconfigurable assembly systems that would exploit the benefits the Cyber Physical paradigm utilizing web technologies, the IoT, the Cloud computing and Big Data."

    abstract "Information and communication technologies are permeating all aspects of industrial and manufacturing systems, expediting the generation of large volumes of industrial data. This article surveys the recent literature on data management as it applies to networked industrial environments and identifies several open research challenges for the future. As a first step, we extract important data properties (volume, variety, traffic, criticality) and identify the corresponding data enabling technologies of diverse fundamental industrial use cases, based on practical applications. Secondly, we provide a detailed outline of recent industrial architectural designs with respect to their data management philosophy (data presence, data coordination, data computation) and the extent of their distributiveness. Then, we conduct a holistic survey of the recent literature from which we derive a taxonomy of the latest advances on industrial data enabling technologies and data centric services, spanning all the way from the field level deep in the physical deployments, up to the cloud and applications level. Finally, motivated by the rich conclusions of this critical analysis, we identify interesting open challenges for future research. The concepts presented in this article thematically cover the largest part of the industrial automation pyramid layers. Our approach is multidisciplinary, as the selected publications were drawn from two fields; the communications, networking and computation field as well as the industrial, manufacturing and automation field. The article can help the readers to deeply understand how data management is currently applied in networked industrial environments, and select interesting open research opportunities to pursue."

    title "towards a semantic administrative shell for industry 4 0 components"
    abstract "In the engineering and manufacturing domain, there is currently an atmosphere of departure to a new era of digitized production. In different regions, initiatives in these directions are known under different names, such as industrie du futur in France, industrial internet in the US or Industrie 4.0 in Germany. While the vision of digitizing production and manufacturing gained much traction lately, it is still relatively unclear how this vision can actually be implemented with concrete standards and technologies. Within the German Industry 4.0 initiative, the concept of an Administrative Shell was devised to respond to these requirements. The Administrative Shell is planned to provide a digital representation of all information being available about and from an object which can be a hardware system or a software platform. In this paper, we present an approach to developing such a digital representation based on semantic knowledge representation formalisms such as RDF, RDF Schema and OWL. We present our concept of a Semantic I4.0 Component which addresses the communication and comprehension challenges in Industry 4.0 scenarios using semantic technologies. Our approach is illustrated with a concrete example showing its benefits in a real-world use case."

The reference architecture model is based on grouping of future and present techniques and presenting the design process through a new hierarchical framework and a new cascading model. With the application of the grounded theory, the hierarchical framework and the cascading model detail a new process for creating a taxonomy of categories and grouping of concepts into integration design. The new design process is tested and versified with an empirical review of Industry 4.0 frameworks and results with a new 5 levels reference architecture step by step model for the integration of these related systems and technologies (Industrial Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems, and Industry 4.0)."
