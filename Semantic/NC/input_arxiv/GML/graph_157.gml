    title "convergence analysis using the edge laplacian robust consensus of nonlinear multi agent systems via iss method"
    abstract "This study develops an original and innovative matrix representation with respect to the information flow for networked multi-agent system. To begin with, the general concepts of the edge Laplacian of digraph are proposed with its algebraic properties. Benefit from this novel graph-theoretic tool, we can build a bridge between the consensus problem and the edge agreement problem; we also show that the edge Laplacian sheds a new light on solving the leaderless consensus problem. Based on the edge agreement framework, the technical challenges caused by unknown but bounded disturbances and inherently nonlinear dynamics can be well handled. In particular, we design an integrated procedure for a new robust consensus protocol that is based on a blend of algebraic graph theory and the newly developed cyclic-small-gain theorem. Besides, to highlight the intricate relationship between the original graph and cyclic-small-gain theorem, the concept of edge-interconnection graph is introduced for the first time. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis."

    title "global h_ infty consensus of multi agent systems with lipschitz nonlinear dynamics"
    abstract "This paper addresses the global consensus problems of a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems with Lipschitz nonlinearity and directed communication graphs, by using a distributed consensus protocol based on the relative states of neighboring agents. A two-step algorithm is presented to construct a protocol, under which a Lipschitz multi-agent system without disturbances can reach global consensus for a strongly connected directed communication graph. Another algorithm is then given to design a protocol which can achieve global consensus with a guaranteed $H_\infty$ performance for a Lipschitz multiagent system subject to external disturbances. The case with a leader-follower communication graph is also discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated through a network of single-link manipulators."

    title "edge agreement of multi agent system with quantized measurements via the directed edge laplacian"
    abstract "This work explores the edge agreement problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system under quantized measurements. Under the edge agreement framework, we introduce an important concept about the \emph{essential edge Laplacian} and also obtain a reduced model of the edge agreement dynamics based on the spanning tree subgraph. The quantized edge agreement problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system is studied, in which both uniform and logarithmic quantizers are considered. We do not only guarantee the stability of the proposed quantized control law, but also reveal the explicit mathematical connection of the quantized interval and the convergence properties for both uniform and logarithmic quantizers, which has not been addressed before. Particularly, for uniform quantizers, we provide the upper bound of the radius of the agreement neighborhood and indicate that the radius increases with the quantization interval. While for logarithmic quantizers, the agents converge exponentially to the desired agreement equilibrium. In addition, we figure out the relationship of the quantization interval and the convergence speed and also provide the estimates of the convergence rate. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis."

    title "average consensus by graph filtering new approach explicit convergence rate and optimal design"
    abstract "This paper revisits the problem of multi-agent consensus from a graph signal processing perspective. Describing a consensus protocol as a graph spectrum filter, we present an effective new approach to the analysis and design of consensus protocols in the graph spectrum domain for the uncertain networks, which are difficult to handle by the existing time-domain methods. This novel approach has led to the following new results in this paper: 1) New necessary and sufficient conditions for both finite-time and asymptotic average consensus of multi-agent systems. 2) Direct link between the consensus convergence rate and the periodic consensus protocols. 3) Conversion of the fast consensus problem to the problem of polynomial design of graph spectrum filter. 4) A Lagrange polynomial interpolation method and a worst-case optimal interpolation method for the design of periodic consensus protocols for the MASs on uncertain graphs. 5) Explicit formulas for the convergence rate of the designed protocols. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity, effectiveness and advantages of these results."

    title "distributed consensus of linear multi agent systems with adaptive dynamic protocols"
    abstract "Abstract   This paper considers the distributed consensus problem of multi-agent systems with general continuous-time linear dynamics for both the cases without and with a leader whose control input might be nonzero and time varying. For the case without a leader, based on the relative output information of neighboring agents, two types of distributed adaptive dynamic consensus protocols are proposed, namely, the edge-based adaptive protocol which assigns a time-varying coupling weight to each edge in the communication graph and the node-based adaptive protocol which uses a time-varying coupling weight for each node. These two adaptive protocols are designed to ensure that consensus is reached in a fully distributed fashion for all undirected connected communication graphs. It is shown that the edge-based adaptive consensus protocol is applicable to arbitrary switching connected graphs. For the case where there exists a leader whose control input is possibly nonzero and bounded, a distributed continuous adaptive protocol is designed to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the consensus error with respect to any communication graph which contains a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root and whose subgraph associated with the followers is undirected, requiring neither global information of the communication graph nor the upper bound of the leader&#8217;s control input. A distributed discontinuous protocol is also discussed as a special case. Simulation examples are finally given to illustrate the theoretical results."

    title "completely distributed guaranteed performance consensualization for high order multiagent systems with switching topologies"
    abstract "The guaranteed-performance consensualization for high-order linear and nonlinear multiagent systems with switching topologies is respectively realized in a completely distributed manner in the sense that consensus design criteria are independent of interaction topologies and switching motions. The current paper firstly proposes an adaptive consensus protocol with guaranteed-performance constraints and switching topologies, where interaction weights among neighboring agents are adaptively adjusted and state errors among all agents can be regulated. Then, a new translation-adaptive strategy is shown to realize completely distributed guaranteed-performance consensus control and an adaptive guaranteed-performance consensualization criterion is given on the basis of the Riccati inequality. Furthermore, an approach to regulate the consensus control gain and the guaranteed-performance cost is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, main conclusions for linear multiagent systems are extended to Lipschitz nonlinear cases. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate theoretical results."

    title "guaranteed cost consensus for multiagent networks with lipschitz nonlinear dynamics and switching topologies"
    abstract "Guaranteed-cost consensus for high-order nonlinear multi-agent networks with switching topologies is investigated. By constructing a time-varying nonsingular matrix with a specific structure, the whole dynamics of multi-agent networks is decomposed into the consensus and disagreement parts with nonlinear terms, which is the key challenge to be dealt with. An explicit expression of the consensus dynamics, which contains the nonlinear term, is given and its initial state is determined. Furthermore, by the structure property of the time-varying nonsingular transformation matrix and the Lipschitz condition, the impacts of the nonlinear term on the disagreement dynamics are linearized and the gain matrix of the consensus protocol is determined on the basis of the Riccati equation. Moreover, an approach to minimize the guaranteed cost is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the numerical simulation is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical results."

    title "structure preserving model reduction of physical network systems by clustering"
    abstract "In this paper, we establish a method for model order reduction of a certain class of physical network systems. The proposed method is based on clustering of the vertices of the underlying graph, and yields a reduced order model within the same class. To capture the physical properties of the network, we allow for weights associated to both the edges as well as the vertices of the graph. We extend the notion of almost equitable partitions to this class of graphs. Consequently, an explicit model reduction error expression in the sense of H2-norm is provided for clustering arising from almost equitable partitions. Finally the method is extended to second-order systems."

    title "event triggered algorithms for leader follower consensus of networked euler lagrange agents"
    abstract "This paper proposes three different distributed event-triggered control algorithms to achieve leader-follower consensus for a network of Euler-Lagrange agents. We firstly propose two model-independent algorithms for a subclass of Euler-Lagrange agents without the vector of gravitational potential forces. By model-independent, we mean that each agent can execute its algorithm with no knowledge of the agent self-dynamics. A variable-gain algorithm is employed when the sensing graph is undirected; algorithm parameters are selected in a fully distributed manner with much greater flexibility compared to all previous work concerning event-triggered consensus problems. When the sensing graph is directed, a constant-gain algorithm is employed. The control gains must be centrally designed to exceed several lower bounding inequalities which require limited knowledge of bounds on the matrices describing the agent dynamics, bounds on network topology information and bounds on the initial conditions. When the Euler-Lagrange agents have dynamics which include the vector of gravitational potential forces, an adaptive algorithm is proposed which requires more information about the agent dynamics but can estimate uncertain agent parameters. #R##N#For each algorithm, a trigger function is proposed to govern the event update times. At each event, the controller is updated, which ensures that the control input is piecewise constant and saves energy resources. We analyse each controllers and trigger function and exclude Zeno behaviour. Extensive simulations show 1) the advantages of our proposed trigger function as compared to those in existing literature, and 2) the effectiveness of our proposed controllers."

    title "consensus of multi agent systems with general linear and lipschitz nonlinear dynamics using distributed adaptive protocols"
    abstract "This technical brief considers the distributed consensus problems for multi-agent systems with general linear and Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics. Distributed relative-state consensus protocols with an adaptive law for adjusting the coupling weights between neighboring agents are designed for both the linear and nonlinear cases, under which consensus is reached for all undirected connected communication graphs. Extensions to the case with a leader-follower communication graph are further studied. In contrast to the existing results in the literature, the adaptive consensus protocols here can be implemented by each agent in a fully distributed fashion without using any global information."

    title "modal barriers to controllability in networks with linearly coupled homogeneous subsystems"
    abstract "The controllability of networks comprising homogeneous multi-input multi-output linear subsystems with linear couplings among them is examined, from a modal perspective. The eigenvalues of the network model are classified into two groups: 1) network-invariant modes, which have very high multiplicity regardless of the network's topology; and 2) special-repeat modes, which are repeated for only particular network topologies and have bounded multiplicity. Characterizations of both types of modes are obtained, in part by drawing on decentralized-fixed-mode and generalized-eigenvalue concepts. We demonstrate that network-invariant modes necessarily prevent controllability unless a sufficient fraction of the subsystems are actuated, both in the network as a whole and in any weakly-connected partition. In contrast, the multiplicities of special-repeat modes have no influence on controllability. Our analysis highlights a distinction between built networks where subsystem interfaces may be unavoidable barriers to controllability, and multi-agent systems where protocols can be designed to ensure controllability."

    title "model reduction of networked passive systems through clustering"
    abstract "In this paper, a model reduction procedure for a network of interconnected identical passive subsystems is presented. Here, rather than performing model reduction on the subsystems, adjacent subsystems are clustered, leading to a reduced-order networked system that allows for a convenient physical interpretation. The identification of the subsystems to be clustered is performed through controllability and observability analysis of an associated edge system and it is shown that the property of synchronization (i.e., the convergence of trajectories of the subsystems to each other) is preserved during reduction. The results are illustrated by means of an example."
