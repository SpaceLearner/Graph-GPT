    abstract "In this paper we characterise the maximal convex subsets of the (non-convex) rate region in 802.11 WLANs. In addition to being of intrinsic interest as a fundamental property of 802.11 WLANs, this characterisation can be exploited to allow the wealth of convex optimisation approaches to be applied to 802.11 WLANs."

    title "towards a collision free wlan dynamic parameter adjustment in csma e2ca"
    abstract "Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA) is a distributed MAC protocol that allows collision-free access to the medium in WLAN. The only difference between CSMA/ECA and the well-known CSMA/CA is that the former uses a deterministic backoff after successful transmissions. Collision-free operation is reached after a transient state during which some collisions may occur. This article shows that the duration of the transient state can be shortened by appropriately setting the contention parameters. Standard absorbing Markov Chain theory can be used to describe the behaviour of the system in the transient state and to predict the expected number of slots to reach the collision-free operation. #R##N#The article also introduces CSMA/E2CA, in which a deterministic backoff is used two consecutive times after a successful transmission. CSMA/E2CA converges quicker to collision-free operation and delivers higher performance than CSMA/CA in harsh wireless scenarios with high frame error rates. #R##N#To achieve collision-free operations when the number of contenders is large, it may be necessary to dynamically adjust the contention parameter. The last part of the article suggests an approach for such parameter adjustment which is validated by simulation results."

    title "max min fairness in 802 11 mesh networks"
    abstract "In this paper we build upon the recent observation that the 802.11 rate region is log-convex and, for the first time, characterise max-min fair rate allocations for a large class of 802.11 wireless mesh networks. By exploiting features of the 802.11e/n MAC, in particular TXOP packet bursting, we are able to use this characterisation to establish a straightforward, practically implementable approach for achieving max-min throughput fairness. We demonstrate that this approach can be readily extended to encompass time-based fairness in multi-rate 802.11 mesh networks."

    title "massive mimo for next generation wireless systems"
    abstract "Multi-user MIMO offers big advantages over conventional point-to-point MIMO: it works with cheap single-antenna terminals, a rich scattering environment is not required, and resource allocation is simplified because every active terminal utilizes all of the time-frequency bins. However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned, with roughly equal numbers of service antennas and terminals and frequency-division duplex operation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as large-scale antenna systems, very large MIMO, hyper MIMO, full-dimension MIMO, and ARGOS) makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a large excess of service antennas over active terminals and time-division duplex operation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever smaller regions of space to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency. Other benefits of massive MIMO include extensive use of inexpensive low-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the MAC layer, and robustness against intentional jamming. The anticipated throughput depends on the propagation environment providing asymptotically orthogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed any limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional research problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently need attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components that work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for newly joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided by the excess of service antennas, reducing internal power consumption to achieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment scenarios. This article presents an overview of the massive MIMO concept and contemporary research on the topic."

    title "survey of spectrum sharing for inter technology coexistence"
    abstract "Increasing capacity demands in emerging wireless technologies are expected to be met by network densification and spectrum bands open to multiple technologies. These will, in turn, increase the level of interference and also result in more complex inter-technology interactions, which will need to be managed through spectrum sharing mechanisms. Consequently, novel spectrum sharing mechanisms should be designed to allow spectrum access for multiple technologies, while efficiently utilizing the spectrum resources overall. Importantly, it is not trivial to design efficient spectrum sharing mechanisms, not only due to technical aspects, but also due to regulatory and business model constraints. In this survey we address spectrum sharing mechanisms for wireless inter-technology coexistence by means of a technology circle that incorporates in a unified, system-level view the technical and non-technical aspects. We thus systematically explore the spectrum sharing design space consisting of parameters at different layers. Using this framework, we present a literature review on inter-technology coexistence with a focus on wireless technologies with the same spectrum access rights, i.e. (i) primary/primary, (ii) secondary/secondary, and (iii) technologies operating in a spectrum commons. Moreover, we reflect on our literature review to identify possible spectrum sharing design solutions and performance evaluation approaches useful for future coexistence cases. Finally, we discuss spectrum sharing design challenges and suggest potential future research directions."

    title "on the performance of packet aggregation in ieee 802 11ac mu mimo wlans"
    abstract "Multi-user spatial multiplexing combined with packet aggregation can significantly increase the performance of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). In this letter, we present and evaluate a simple technique to perform packet aggregation in IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO (Multi-user Multiple Input Multiple Output) WLANs. Results show that in non-saturation conditions both the number of active stations (STAs) and the queue size have a significant impact on the system performance. If the number of stations is excessively high, the heterogeneity of destinations in the packets contained in the queue makes it difficult to take full advantage of packet aggregation. This effect can be alleviated by increasing the queue size, which increases the chances to schedule a large number of packets at each transmission, hence improving the system throughput at the cost of a higher delay."

    title "interference aware opportunistic random access in dense iot networks"
    abstract "Due to the difficulty of coordination in multi-cell random access, it is a practical challenge how to achieve the optimal throughput with decentralized transmission. In this paper, we propose a decentralized interference-aware opportunistic random access (IA-ORA) protocol that achieves the optimal throughput scaling in an ultra-dense multi-cell random access network with one access point (AP) and a number of users in each cell. Unlike opportunistic scheduling for cellular multiple access where users are selected by base stations, under our IA-ORA protocol, each user opportunistically transmits with a predefined physical layer data rate in a decentralized manner if the desired signal power to the serving AP is sufficiently large and the generating interference leakage power to the other APs is sufficiently small (i.e., two threshold conditions are fulfilled). As a main result, it is proved that the optimal aggregate physical layer throughput scaling (i.e., the MAC throughput of $\frac{1}{e}$ in a cell and the power gain) is achieved in a high signal-to-noise ratio regime if the number of per-cell users is higher than a certain level. In addition, numerical evaluation via intensive computer simulations confirms that under practical settings, the proposed IA-ORA protocol outperforms conventional opportunistic random access protocols in terms of aggregate throughput."

    abstract "As wireless devices boom and bandwidth-hungry applications (e.g., video and cloud uploading) get popular, today's wireless local area networks (WLANs) become not only crowded but also stressed at throughput. Multiuser multiple-input&#8211;multiple-output (MU-MIMO), an advanced form of MIMO, has gained attention due to its huge potential in improving the performance of WLANs. This paper surveys random access-based medium access control (MAC) protocols for MU-MIMO-enabled WLANs. It first provides background information about the evolution and the fundamental MAC schemes of IEEE 802.11 Standards and Amendments, and then identifies the key requirements of designing MU-MIMO MAC protocols for WLANs. After this, the most representative MU-MIMO MAC proposals in the literature are overviewed by benchmarking their MAC procedures and examining the key components, such as the channel state information acquisition, decoding/precoding, and scheduling schemes. Classifications and discussions on important findings of the surveyed MAC protocols are provided, based on which, the research challenges for designing effective MU-MIMO MAC protocols, as well as the envisaged MAC's role in the future heterogeneous networks, are highlighted."

    title "pushing the limits of full duplex design and real time implementation"
    abstract "Recent work has shown the feasibility of single-channel full-duplex wireless physical layer, allowing nodes to send and receive in the same frequency band at the same time. In this report, we first design and implement a real-time 64-subcarrier 10 MHz full-duplex OFDM physical layer, FD-PHY. The proposed FD-PHY not only allows synchronous full-duplex transmissions but also selective asynchronous full-duplex modes. Further, we show that in over-the-air experiments using optimal antenna placement on actual devices, the self-interference can be suppressed upto 80dB, which is 10dB more than prior reported results. Then we propose a full-duplex MAC protocol, FD-MAC, which builds on IEEE 802.11 with three new mechanisms -- shared random backoff, header snooping and virtual backoffs. The new mechanisms allow FD-MAC to discover and exploit full-duplex opportunities in a distributed manner. Our over-the-air tests show over 70% throughput gains from using full-duplex over half-duplex in realistically used cases."

    title "design and characterization of a full duplex multiantenna system for wifi networks"
    abstract "In this paper, we present an experiment- and simulation-based study to evaluate the use of full duplex (FD) as a potential mode in practical IEEE 802.11 networks. To enable the study, we designed a 20-MHz multiantenna orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) FD physical layer and an FD media access control (MAC) protocol, which is backward compatible with current 802.11. Our extensive over-the-air experiments, simulations, and analysis demonstrate the following two results. First, the use of multiple antennas at the physical layer leads to a higher ergodic throughput than its hardware-equivalent multiantenna half-duplex (HD) counterparts for SNRs above the median SNR encountered in practical WiFi deployments. Second, the proposed MAC translates the physical layer rate gain into near doubling of throughput for multinode single-AP networks. The two results allow us to conclude that there are potentially significant benefits gained from including an FD mode in future WiFi standards."

    abstract "With the ever-increasing demand for wireless traffic and quality of serives (QoS), wireless local area networks (WLANs) have developed into one of the most dominant wireless networks that fully influence human life. As the most widely used WLANs standard, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 will release the upcoming next generation WLANs standard amendment: IEEE 802.11ax. This article comprehensively surveys and analyzes the application scenarios, technical requirements, standardization process, key technologies, and performance evaluations of IEEE 802.11ax. Starting from the technical objectives and requirements of IEEE 802.11ax, this article pays special attention to high-dense deployment scenarios. After that, the key technologies of IEEE 802.11ax, including the physical layer (PHY) enhancements, multi-user (MU) medium access control (MU-MAC), spatial reuse (SR), and power efficiency are discussed in detail, covering both standardization technologies as well as the latest academic studies. Furthermore, performance requirements of IEEE 802.11ax are evaluated via a newly proposed systems and link-level integrated simulation platform (SLISP). Simulations results confirm that IEEE 802.11ax significantly improves the user experience in high-density deployment, while successfully achieves the average per user throughput requirement in project authorization request (PAR) by four times compared to the legacy IEEE 802.11. Finally, potential advancement beyond IEEE 802.11ax are discussed to complete this holistic study on the latest IEEE 802.11ax. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first study to directly investigate and analyze the latest stable version of IEEE 802.11ax, and the first work to thoroughly and deeply evaluate the compliance of the performance requirements of IEEE 802.11ax."

    title "wireless optimisation via convex bandits unlicensed lte wifi coexistence"
    abstract "Bandit Convex Optimisation (BCO) is a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in non-stationary and partially observable environments. In a BCO problem, a decision-maker sequentially picks actions to minimize the cumulative cost associated with these decisions, all while receiving partial feedback about the state of the environment. This formulation is a very natural fit for wireless-network optimisation problems and has great application potential since: i) instead of assuming full observability of the network state, it only requires the metric to optimise as input, and ii) it provides strong performance guarantees while making only minimal assumptions about the network dynamics. Despite these advantages, BCO has not yet been explored in the context of wireless-network optimisation. In this paper, we make the first steps to demonstrate the potential of BCO techniques by formulating an unlicensed LTE/WiFi fair coexistence use case in the framework, and providing experimental results in a simulated environment. On the algorithmic front, we propose a simple and natural sequential multi-point BCO algorithm amenable to wireless networking optimisation, and provide its theoretical analysis. We expect the contributions of this paper to pave the way to further research on the application of online convex methods in the bandit setting."

    title "uni mumac a unified down up link mu mimo mac protocol for ieee 802 11ac wlans"
    abstract "Due to the dominance of the downlink traffic in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), a large number of previous research efforts have been put to enhance the downlink transmission, namely, from the Access Point (AP) to stations (STAs). The downlink Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technique, supported by the latest IEEE amendment-802.11ac, is considered as one of the key enhancements leading WLANs to the Gigabit era. However, as cloud uploading services, Peer-to-Peer and telepresence applications get popular, the need for higher uplink capacity becomes inevitable. In this paper, a unified down/up-link Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol called Uni-MUMAC is proposed to enhance the performance of IEEE 802.11ac WLANs by exploring the multi-user spatial multiplexing technique. Specifically, in the downlink, we implement an IEEE 802.11ac-compliant MU-MIMO transmission scheme to allow the AP to simultaneously send frames to a group of STAs. In the uplink, we extend the traditional one round channel access contention to two rounds, which coordinate multiple STAs to transmit frames to the AP simultaneously. 2-nd round Contention Window $$(CW_{\rm 2nd})$$(CW2nd), a parameter that makes the length of the 2-nd contention round elastic according to the traffic condition, is introduced. Uni-MUMAC is evaluated through simulations in saturated and non-saturated conditions when both downlink and uplink traffic are present in the system. We also propose an analytic saturation model to validate the simulation results. By properly setting $$CW_{\rm 2nd}$$CW2nd and other parameters, Uni-MUMAC is compared to a prominent multi-user transmission scheme in the literature. The results exhibit that Uni-MUMAC not only performs well in the downlink-dominant scenario, but it is also able to balance both the downlink and uplink throughput in the emerging uplink bandwidth-hungry scenario."

    title "evolution toward 5g multi tier cellular wireless networks an interference management perspective"
    abstract "The evolving fifth generation (5G) cellular wireless networks are envisioned to overcome the fundamental challenges of existing cellular networks, for example, higher data rates, excellent end-to-end performance, and user-coverage in hot-spots and crowded areas with lower latency, energy consumption, and cost per information transfer. To address these challenges, 5G systems will adopt a multi-tier architecture consisting of macrocells, different types of licensed small cells, relays, and device-to-device (D2D) networks to serve users with different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in a spectrum and energy-efficient manner. Starting with the visions and requirements of 5G multi-tier networks, this article outlines the challenges of interference management (e.g. power control, cell association) in these networks with shared spectrum access (i.e. when the different network tiers share the same licensed spectrum). It is argued that the existing interference management schemes will not be able to address the interference management problem in prioritized 5G multi-tier networks where users in different tiers have different priorities for channel access. In this context a survey and qualitative comparison of the existing cell association and power control schemes is provided to demonstrate their limitations for interference management in 5G networks. Open challenges are highlighted and guidelines are provided to modify the existing schemes in order to overcome these limitations and make them suitable for the emerging 5G systems."

The result is a principled approach to offload from LTE to 802.11 and for exploiting LTE/802.11 path diversity to meet user traffic demands."

    title "multi round contention in wireless lans with multipacket reception"
    abstract "Multi-packet reception (MPR) has been recognized as a powerful capacity-enhancement technique for randomaccess wireless local area networks (WLANs). As is common with all random access protocols, the wireless channel is often under-utilized in MPR WLANs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-round contention random-access protocol to address this problem. This work complements the existing randomaccess methods that are based on single-round contention. In the proposed scheme, stations are given multiple chances to contend for the channel until there are a sufficient number of ?winning? stations that can share the MPR channel for data packet transmission. The key issue here is the identification of the optimal time to stop the contention process and start data transmission. The solution corresponds to finding a desired tradeoff between channel utilization and contention overhead. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis to characterize the optimal strategy using the theory of optimal stopping. An interesting result is that the optimal stopping strategy is a simple threshold-based rule, which stops the contention process as soon as the total number of winning stations exceeds a certain threshold. Compared with the conventional single-round contention protocol, the multi-round contention scheme significantly enhances channel utilization when the MPR capability of the channel is small to medium. Meanwhile, the scheme automatically falls back to single-round contention when the MPR capability is very large, in which case the throughput penalty due to random access is already small even with single-round contention."

    title "an overview on resource allocation techniques for multi user mimo systems"
    abstract "Remarkable research activities and major advances have been occurred over the past decade in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Several transmission technologies and precoding techniques have been developed in order to exploit the spatial dimension so that simultaneous transmission of independent data streams reuse the same radio resources. The achievable performance of such techniques heavily depends on the channel characteristics of the selected users, the amount of channel knowledge, and how efficiently interference is mitigated. In systems where the total number of receivers is larger than the number of total transmit antennas, user selection becomes a key approach to benefit from multiuser diversity and achieve full multiplexing gain. The overall performance of MU-MIMO systems is a complex joint multi-objective optimization problem since many variables and parameters have to be optimized, including the number of users, the number of antennas, spatial signaling, rate and power allocation, and transmission technique. The objective of this literature survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the various methodologies used to approach the aforementioned joint optimization task in the downlink of MU-MIMO communication systems."

We argue that even better WLAN performance can be achieved by slightly modifying the DL-MU-MIMO scheduling. To this end we propose a new queuing mechanism based on the decoupling of EDCA and DL-MU-MIMO scheduling (DEMS) to avoid head-of-line blocking. We show that DEMS outperforms traditional 802.11ac scheduling based on first in, first out transmission queues. The improvement is shown in terms throughput achieved with: (a) more efficient channel usage, (b) increased probability of transmission of high priority traffic, and (c) decreased competition between frames destined to distinct users."
