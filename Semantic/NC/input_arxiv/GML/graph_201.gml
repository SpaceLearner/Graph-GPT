    title "constructions of snake in the box codes under ell_ infty metric for rank modulation"
    abstract "In the rank modulation scheme, Gray codes are very useful in the realization of flash memories. For a Gray code in this scheme, two adjacent codewords are obtained by using one &#34;push-to-the-top&#34; operation. Moreover, snake-in-the-box codes under the $\ell_{\infty}$-metric are Gray codes, which can be capable of detecting one $\ell_{\infty}$-error. In this paper, we give two constructions of $\ell_{\infty}$-snakes. On the one hand, inspired by Yehezkeally and Schwartz's construction, we present a new construction of the $\ell_{\infty}$-snake. The length of this $\ell_{\infty}$-snake is longer than the length of the $\ell_{\infty}$-snake constructed by Yehezkeally and Schwartz. On the other hand, we also give another construction of $\ell_{\infty}$-snakes by using $\mathcal{K}$-snakes and obtain the longer $\ell_{\infty}$-snakes than the previously known ones."

    title "compression in the space of permutations"
    abstract "We investigate lossy compression (source coding) of data in the form of permutations. This problem has direct applications in the storage of ordinal data or rankings, and in the analysis of sorting algorithms. We analyze the rate-distortion characteristic for the permutation space under the uniform distribution, and the minimum achievable rate of compression that allows a bounded distortion after recovery. Our analysis is with respect to different practical and useful distortion measures, including Kendall tau distance, Spearman&#8217;s footrule, Chebyshev distance, and inversion-   $\ell _{1}$    distance. We establish equivalence of source code designs under certain distortions and show simple explicit code designs that incur low encoding/decoding complexities and are asymptotically optimal. Finally, we show that for the Mallows model, a popular nonuniform ranking model on the permutation space, both the entropy and the maximum distortion at zero rate are much lower than the uniform counterparts, which motivates the future design of efficient compression schemes for this model."

    title "dense error correcting codes in the lee metric"
    abstract "Several new applications and a number of new mathematical techniques have increased the research on error-correcting codes in the Lee metric in the last decade. In this work we consider several coding problems and constructions of error-correcting codes in the Lee metric. First, we consider constructions of dense error-correcting codes in relatively small dimensions over small alphabets. The second problem we solve is construction of diametric perfect codes with minimum distance four. We will construct such codes over various lengths and alphabet sizes. The third problem is to transfer an n-dimensional Lee sphere with large radius into a shape, with the same volume, located in a relatively small box. Hadamard matrices play an essential role in the solutions for all three problems. A construction of codes based on Hadamard matrices will start our discussion. These codes approach the sphere packing bound for very high rate range and appear to be the best known codes over some sets of parameters."

    title "constrained codes for rank modulation"
    abstract "Motivated by the rank modulation scheme, a recent work by Sala and Dolecek explored the study of constraint codes for permutations. The constraint studied by them is inherited by the inter-cell interference phenomenon in flash memories, where high-level cells can inadvertently increase the level of low-level cells. #R##N#In this paper, the model studied by Sala and Dolecek is extended into two constraints. A permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ satisfies the \emph{two-neighbor $k$-constraint} if for all $2 \leq i \leq n-1$ either $|\sigma(i-1)-\sigma(i)|\leq k$ or $|\sigma(i)-\sigma(i+1)|\leq k$, and it satisfies the \emph{asymmetric two-neighbor $k$-constraint} if for all $2 \leq i \leq n-1$, either $\sigma(i-1)-\sigma(i) < k$ or $\sigma(i+1)-\sigma(i) < k$. We show that the capacity of the first constraint is $(1+\epsilon)/2$ in case that $k=\Theta(n^{\epsilon})$ and the capacity of the second constraint is 1 regardless to the value of $k$. We also extend our results and study the capacity of these two constraints combined with error-correction codes in the Kendall's $\tau$ metric."

    title "snake in the box codes for rank modulation"
    abstract "Motivated by the rank-modulation scheme with applications to flash memory, we consider Gray codes capable of detecting a single error, also known as snake-in-the-box codes. We study two error metrics: Kendall's $\tau$-metric, which applies to charge-constrained errors, and the $\ell_\infty$-metric, which is useful in the case of limited magnitude errors. In both cases we construct snake-in-the-box codes with rate asymptotically tending to 1. We also provide efficient successor-calculation functions, as well as ranking and unranking functions. Finally, we also study bounds on the parameters of such codes."

    abstract "Sidon sequences and their generalizations have found during the years and especially recently various applications in coding theory. One of the most important applications of these sequences is in the connection of synchronization patterns. A few constructions of two-dimensional synchronization patterns are based on these sequences. In this paper we present sufficient conditions that a two-dimensional synchronization pattern can be transformed into a Sidon sequence. We also present a new construction for Sidon sequences over an alphabet of size q(q-1), where q is a power of a prime."

    abstract "A well-known conjecture of Golomb and Welch is that the only nontrivial perfect codes in the Lee and Manhattan metrics have length two or minimum distance three. This problem and related topics were subject for extensive research in the last 40 years. In this paper, two product constructions for perfect Lee codes and diameter perfect Lee codes are presented. These constructions yield a large number of nonlinear perfect codes and nonlinear diameter perfect codes in the Lee and Manhattan metrics. A short survey and other related problems on perfect codes in the Lee and Manhattan metrics are also discussed."

    title "quasi cross lattice tilings with applications to flash memory"
    abstract "We consider lattice tilings of $\R^n$ by a shape we call a $(\kp,\km,n)$-quasi-cross. Such lattices form perfect error-correcting codes which correct a single limited-magnitude error with prescribed maximal-magnitudes of positive error and negative error (the ratio of which is called the balance ratio). These codes can be used to correct both disturb and retention errors in flash memories, which are characterized by having limited magnitudes and different signs. #R##N#We construct infinite families of perfect codes for any rational balance ratio, and provide a specific construction for $(2,1,n)$-quasi-cross lattice tiling. The constructions are related to group splitting and modular $B_1$ sequences. We also study bounds on the parameters of lattice-tilings by quasi-crosses, connecting the arm lengths of the quasi-crosses and the dimension. We also prove constraints on group splitting, a specific case of which shows that the parameters of the lattice tiling of $(2,1,n)$-quasi-crosses is the only ones possible."

    abstract "Codes for rank modulation have been recently proposed as a means of protecting flash memory devices from errors. We study basic coding theoretic problems for such codes, representing them as subsets of the set of permutations of n elements equipped with the Kendall tau distance. We derive several lower and upper bounds on the size of codes. These bounds enable us to establish the exact scaling of the size of optimal codes for large values of n. We also show the existence of codes whose size is within a constant factor of the sphere packing bound for any fixed number of errors."

    title "coding for locality in reconstructing permutations"
    abstract "The problem of storing permutations in a distributed manner arises in several common scenarios, such as efficient updates of a large, encrypted, or compressed data set. This problem may be addressed in either a combinatorial or a coding approach. The former approach boils down to presenting large sets of permutations with locality, that is, any symbol of the permutation can be computed from a small set of other symbols. In the latter approach, a permutation may be coded in order to achieve locality. This paper focuses on the combinatorial approach. We provide upper and lower bounds for the maximal size of a set of permutations with locality, and provide several simple constructions which attain the upper bound. In cases where the upper bound is not attained, we provide alternative constructions using Reed-Solomon codes, permutation polynomials, and multipermutations."

The mathematical basis of the problem is the construction and design of sequences that may be discriminated based on a collection of their substrings observed through a noisy channel. We explain the connection between the sequence reconstruction problem and the problem of DNA synthesis and sequencing, and introduce the notion of a DNA storage channel. We analyze the number of sequence equivalence classes under the channel mapping and propose new asymmetric coding techniques to combat the effects of synthesis and sequencing noise. In our analysis, we make use of restricted de Bruijn graphs and Ehrhart theory for rational polytopes."

    title "lp decodable multipermutation codes"
    abstract "In this paper, we introduce a new way of constructing and decoding multipermutation codes. Multipermutations are permutations of a multiset that generally consist of duplicate entries. We first introduce a class of binary matrices called multipermutation matrices, each of which corresponds to a unique and distinct multipermutation. By enforcing a set of linear constraints on these matrices, we define a new class of codes that we term LP-decodable multipermutation codes. In order to decode these codes using a linear program (LP), thereby enabling soft decoding, we characterize the convex hull of multipermutation matrices. This characterization allows us to relax the coding constraints to a polytope and to derive two LP decoding problems. These two problems are respectively formulated by relaxing the maximum likelihood decoding problem and the minimum Chebyshev distance decoding problem. #R##N#Because these codes are non-linear, we also study efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. We first describe an algorithm that maps consecutive integers, one by one, to an ordered list of multipermutations. Based on this algorithm, we develop an encoding algorithm for a code proposed by Shieh and Tsai, a code that falls into our class of LP-decodable multipermutation codes. Regarding decoding algorithms, we propose an efficient distributed decoding algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we observe from simulation results that the soft decoding techniques we introduce can significantly outperform hard decoding techniques that are based on quantized channel outputs."

    title "correcting limited magnitude errors in the rank modulation scheme"
    abstract "We study error-correcting codes for permutations under the infinity norm, motivated by a novel storage scheme for flash memories call rank modulation. In this scheme, a set of $n$ flash cells are combined to create a single virtual multi-level cell. Information is stored in the permutation induced by the cell charge levels. Spike errors, which are characterized by a limited-magnitude change in cell charge levels, correspond to a low-distance change under the infinity norm. #R##N#We define codes protecting against spike errors, called limited-magnitude rank-modulation codes (LMRM codes), and present several constructions for these codes, some resulting in optimal codes. These codes admit simple recursive, and sometimes direct, encoding and decoding procedures. #R##N#We also provide lower and upper bounds on the maximal size of LMRM codes both in the general case, and in the case where the codes form a subgroup of the symmetric group. In the asymptotic analysis, the codes we construct out-perform the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound estimate."

    title "worst case vs average case design for estimation from fixed pairwise comparisons"
    abstract "Pairwise comparison data arises in many domains, including tournament rankings, web search, and preference elicitation. Given noisy comparisons of a fixed subset of pairs of items, we study the problem of estimating the underlying comparison probabilities under the assumption of strong stochastic transitivity (SST). We also consider the noisy sorting subclass of the SST model. We show that when the assignment of items to the topology is arbitrary, these permutation-based models, unlike their parametric counterparts, do not admit consistent estimation for most comparison topologies used in practice. We then demonstrate that consistent estimation is possible when the assignment of items to the topology is randomized, thus establishing a dichotomy between worst-case and average-case designs. We propose two estimators in the average-case setting and analyze their risk, showing that it depends on the comparison topology only through the degree sequence of the topology. The rates achieved by these estimators are shown to be optimal for a large class of graphs. Our results are corroborated by simulations on multiple comparison topologies."

We consider snake-in-the-box codes under Kendall's $\tau$-metric, which is a Gray code capable of detecting one Kendall's $\tau$-error. We answer two open problems posed by Horovitz and Etzion. Firstly, we prove the validity of a construction given by them, resulting in a snake of size $M_{2n+1}=\frac{(2n+1)!}{2}-2n+1$. Secondly, we come up with a different construction aiming at a longer snake of size $M_{2n+1}=\frac{(2n+1)!}{2}-2n+3$. The construction is applied successfully to $S_7$."

    title "constructions of rank modulation codes"
    abstract "Rank modulation is a way of encoding information to correct errors in flash memory devices as well as impulse noise in transmission lines. Modeling rank modulation involves construction of packings of the space of permutations equipped with the Kendall tau distance. #R##N#We present several general constructions of codes in permutations that cover a broad range of code parameters. In particular, we show a number of ways in which conventional error-correcting codes can be modified to correct errors in the Kendall space. Codes that we construct afford simple encoding and decoding algorithms of essentially the same complexity as required to correct errors in the Hamming metric. For instance, from binary BCH codes we obtain codes correcting $t$ Kendall errors in $n$ memory cells that support the order of $n!/(\log_2n!)^t$ messages, for any constant $t= 1,2,...$ We also construct families of codes that correct a number of errors that grows with $n$ at varying rates, from $\Theta(n)$ to $\Theta(n^{2})$. One of our constructions gives rise to a family of rank modulation codes for which the trade-off between the number of messages and the number of correctable Kendall errors approaches the optimal scaling rate. Finally, we list a number of possibilities for constructing codes of finite length, and give examples of rank modulation codes with specific parameters."

Local rank-modulation is a generalization of the rank-modulation scheme, which has been recently suggested as a way of storing information in flash memory. We study Gray codes for the local rank-modulation scheme in order to simulate conventional multi-level flash cells while retaining the benefits of rank modulation. Unlike the limited scope of previous works, we consider code constructions for the entire range of parameters including the code length, sliding window size, and overlap between adjacent windows. We show our constructed codes have asymptotically-optimal rate. We also provide efficient encoding, decoding, and next-state algorithms."

We focus on the regime of balls with radius $r = \rho \cdot (n\!-\!1)$, $\rho \in [0,1]$, i.e., a radius that is a constant fraction of the maximum possible distance. We provide new lower bounds on the size of such balls. These new lower bounds reduce the asymptotic gap to the known upper bounds to at most $0.029$ bits per symbol. Additionally, they imply an improved ball-packing bound for error-correcting codes, and an improved upper bound on the size of optimal covering codes."

    abstract "Motivated by communication channels in which the transmitted sequences are subjected to random permutations, as well as by certain DNA storage systems, we study the error control problem in settings where the information is stored/transmitted in the form of multisets of symbols from a given finite alphabet. A general channel model is assumed in which the transmitted multisets are potentially impaired by insertions, deletions, substitutions, and erasures of symbols. Several constructions of error-correcting codes for this channel are described, and bounds on the size of optimal codes correcting any given number of errors are derived. The construction based on the notion of Sidon sets in finite Abelian groups is shown to be optimal, in the sense of the asymptotic scaling of code redundancy, for any error radius and alphabet size. It is also shown to be optimal in the stronger sense of maximal code cardinality in various cases."
