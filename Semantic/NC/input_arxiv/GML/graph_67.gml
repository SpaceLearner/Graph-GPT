    title "length based cryptanalysis the case of thompson s group"
    abstract "The length-based approach is a heuristic for solving randomly generated equations in groups that possess a reasonably behaved length function. We describe several improvements of the previously suggested length-based algorithms, which make them applicable to Thompson's group with significant success rates. In particular, this shows that the Shpilrain-Ushakov public key cryp- tosystem based on Thompson's group is insecure, and suggests that no practical public key cryp- tosystem based on the difficulty of solving an equation in this group can be secure."

    title "braid group cryptography"
    abstract "In the last decade, a number of public key cryptosystems based on com- binatorial group theoretic problems in braid groups have been proposed. We survey these cryptosystems and some known attacks on them. #R##N#This survey includes: Basic facts on braid groups and on the Garside normal form of its elements, some known algorithms for solving the word problem in the braid group, the major public-key cryptosystems based on the braid group, and some of the known attacks on these cryptosystems. We conclude with a discussion of future directions (which includes also a description of cryptosystems which are based on other non-commutative groups)."

    title "polynomial time solutions of computational problems in noncommutative algebraic cryptography"
    abstract "We introduce the linear centralizer method, and use it to devise a provable polynomial-time solution of the Commutator Key Exchange Problem, the computational problem on which, in the passive adversary model, the security of the Anshel---Anshel---Goldfeld (Anshel et al., Math. Res. Lett. 6:287---291, 1999) Commutator key exchange protocol is based. We also apply this method to solve, in polynomial time, the computational problem underlying the Centralizer key exchange protocol, introduced by Shpilrain and Ushakov in (Contemp. Math. 418:161---167, 2006).#R##N##R##N#This is the first provable polynomial-time cryptanalysis of the Commutator key exchange protocol, hitherto the most important key exchange protocol in the realm of noncommutative algebraic cryptography, and the first cryptanalysis (of any kind) of the Centralizer key exchange protocol. Unlike earlier cryptanalyses of the Commutator key exchange protocol, our cryptanalyses cannot be foiled by changing the distributions used in the protocol."

    title "post quantum cryptography s381 cyclic subgroup of high order"
    abstract "Currently there is an active Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) solutions search, which attempts to find cryptographic protocols resistant to attacks by means of for instance Shor polynomial time algorithm for numerical field problems like integer factorization (IFP) or the discrete logarithm (DLP). The use of non-commutative or non-associative structures are, among others, valid choices for these kinds of protocols. In our case, we focus on a permutation subgroup of high order and belonging to the symmetric group S381. Using adequate one-way functions (OWF), we derived a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and an ElGamal ciphering procedure that only relies on combinatorial operations. Both OWF pose hard search problems which are assumed as not belonging to BQP time-complexity class. Obvious advantages of present protocols are their conceptual simplicity, fast throughput implementations, high cryptanalytic security and no need for arithmetic operations and therefore extended precision libraries. Such features make them suitable for low performance and low power consumption platforms like smart cards, USB-keys and cellphones."

    title "weighted automata on infinite words in the context of attacker defender games"
    abstract "We consider infinite-state Attacker-Defender games with reachability objectives. The results of the paper are twofold. Firstly we prove a new language-theoretic result for weighted automata on infinite words and show its encoding into the framework of Attacker-Defender games. Secondly we use this novel concept to prove undecidability for checking existence of a winning strategy in several low-dimensional mathematical games including vector reachability games, word games and braid games."

    title "non associative public key cryptography"
    abstract "We introduce a generalized Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld (AAG) key establishment protocol (KEP) for magmas. This leads to the foundation of non-associative public-key cryptography (PKC), generalizing the concept of non-commutative PKC. We show that left selfdistributive systems appear in a natural special case of a generalized AAG-KEP for magmas, and we propose, among others instances, concrete realizations using $f$-conjugacy in groups and shifted conjugacy in braid groups. We discuss the advantages of our schemes compared with the classical AAG-KEP based on conjugacy in braid groups."

In this paper, we discuss the use of a different kind of polycyclic groups, Heisenberg groups, as a platform group for AAG by submitting Heisenberg groups to one of AAG's major attacks, the length-based attack."

    title "composition problems for braids membership identity and freeness"
    abstract "In this paper we investigate the decidability and complexity of problems related to braid composition. While all known problems for a class of braids with three strands, $B_3$, have polynomial time solutions we prove that a very natural question for braid composition, the membership problem, is NP-complete for braids with only three strands. The membership problem is decidable in NP for $B_3$, but it becomes harder for a class of braids with more strands. In particular we show that fundamental problems about braid compositions are undecidable for braids with at least five strands, but decidability of these problems for $B_4$ remains open. Finally we show that the freeness problem for semigroups of braids from $B_3$ is also decidable in NP. #R##N#The paper introduces a few challenging algorithmic problems about topological braids opening new connections between braid groups, combinatorics on words, complexity theory and provides solutions for some of these problems by application of several techniques from automata theory, matrix semigroups and algorithms."

    title "using shifted conjugacy in braid based cryptography"
    abstract "Conjugacy is not the only possible primitive for designing braid-based protocols. To illustrate this principle, we describe a Fiat--Shamir-style authentication protocol that be can be implemented using any binary operation that satisfies the left self-distributive law. Conjugation is an example of such an operation, but there are other examples, in particular the shifted conjugation on Artin's braid group B\_oo, and the finite Laver tables. In both cases, the underlying structures have a high combinatorial complexity, and they lead to difficult problems."

    title "the status of polycyclic group based cryptography a survey and open problems"
    abstract "Polycyclic groups are natural generalizations of cyclic groups but with more complicated algorithmic properties. They are finitely presented and the word, conjugacy, and isomorphism decision problems are all solvable in these groups. Moreover, the non-virtually nilpotent ones exhibit an exponential growth rate. These properties make them suitable for use in group-based cryptography, which was proposed in 2004 by Eick and Kahrobaei. Since then, many cryptosystems have been created that employ polycyclic groups. These include key exchanges such as non-commutative ElGamal, authentication schemes based on the twisted conjugacy problem, and secret sharing via the word problem. In response, heuristic and deterministic methods of cryptanalysis have been developed, including the length-based and linear decomposition attacks. Despite these efforts, there are classes of infinite polycyclic groups that remain suitable for cryptography. The analysis of algorithms for search and decision problems in polycyclic groups has also been developed. In addition to results for the aforementioned problems we present those concerning polycyclic representations, group morphisms, and orbit decidability. Though much progress has been made, many algorithmic and complexity problems remain unsolved, we conclude with a number of them. Of particular interest is to show that cryptosystems using infinite polycyclic groups are resistant to cryptanalysis on a quantum computer."

    title "iterated ld problem in non associative key establishment"
    abstract "We construct new non-associative key establishment protocols for all left self-distributive (LD), multi-LD-, and mutual LD-systems. The hard- ness of these protocols relies on variations of the (simultaneous) iterated LD- problem and its generalizations. We discuss instantiations of these protocols using generalized shifted conjugacy in braid groups and their quotients, LD- conjugacy and f-symmetric conjugacy in groups. We suggest parameter choices for instantiations in braid groups, symmetric groups and several matrix groups."

    title "length based attacks for certain group based encryption rewriting systems"
    abstract "In this note, we describe a probabilistic attack on public key cryptosystems based on the word/conjugacy problems for finitely presented groups of the type proposed recently by Anshel, Anshel and Goldfeld. In such a scheme, one makes use of the property that in the given group the word problem has a polynomial time solution, while the conjugacy problem has no known polynomial solution. An example is the braid group from topology in which the word problem is solvable in polynomial time while the only known solutions to the conjugacy problem are exponential. The attack in this paper is based on having a canonical representative of each string relative to which a length function may be computed. Hence the term length attack. Such canonical representatives are known to exist for the braid group."
