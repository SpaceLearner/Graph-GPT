    title "from altruism to non cooperation in routing games"
    abstract "The paper studies the routing in the network shared by several users. Each user seeks to optimize either its own performance or some combination between its own performance and that of other users, by controlling the routing of its given flow demand. We parameterize the degree of cooperation which allows to cover the fully non-cooperative behavior, the fully cooperative behavior, and even more, the fully altruistic behavior, all these as special cases of the parameter's choice. A large part of the w ork consists in exploring the impact of the degree of cooperation on the equilibrium. Our first finding is to identify multiple Nas h equilibria with cooperative behavior that do not occur in the non-cooperative case under the same conditions (cost, demand and topology). We then identify Braess like paradox (in which adding capacity or adding a link to a network results in worse performance to all users) in presence of user's cooperation . We identify another type of paradox in cooperation scenario: when a given user increases its degree of cooperation while other users keep unchanged their degree of cooperation, this may lead to an improvement in performance of that given user. We then pursue the exploration and carry it on to the setting of Mixed equilibrium (i.e. some users are non atomic-they have infinitesimally small demand, and other have finite fixed dema nd). We finally obtain some theoretical results that show that for low degree of cooperation the equilibrium is unique, confirming the results of our numerical study. I. I NTRODUCTION"

    title "a stackelberg game model for overlay d2d transmission with heterogeneous rate requirements"
    abstract "This paper studies the performance of overlay device-to-device (D2D) communication links via carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols. We assume that the D2D links have heterogeneous rate requirements and different willingness to pay, and each of them acts nonaltruistically to achieve its target rate while maximizing its own payoff. Spatial reuse is allowed if the links are not interfering with each other. A noncooperative game model is used to address the resource allocation among the D2D links, at the same time leveraging on the ideal CSMA network (ICN) model to address the physical channel access issue. We propose a Stackelberg game in which the base station (BS) in the cellular network acts as a Stackelberg leader to regulate the individual payoff by modifying the unit service price so that the total D2D throughput is maximized. The problem is shown to be quasi-convex and can be solved by a sequence of equivalent convex optimization problems. The pricing strategies are designed so that the network always operates within the feasible throughput region. The results are verified by simulations."

    title "regulation of off network pricing in a nonneutral network"
    abstract "Representatives of several Internet service providers (ISPs) have expressed their wish to see a substantial change in the pricing policies of the Internet. In particular, they would like to see content providers (CPs) pay for use of the network, given the large amount of resources they use. This would be in clear violation of the &#34;network neutrality&#34; principle that had characterized the development of the wireline Internet. Our first goal in this paper is to propose and study possible ways of implementing such payments and of regulating their amount. We introduce a model that includes the users' behavior, the utilities of the ISP and of the CPs, and the monetary flow that involves the content users, the ISP and CP, and in particular, the CP's revenues from advertisements. We consider various game models and study the resulting equilibria; they are all combinations of a noncooperative game (in which the ISPs and CPs determine how much they will charge the users) with a &#34;cooperative&#34; one on how the CP and the ISP share the payments. We include in our model a possible asymmetric weighting parameter (that varies between zero to one). We also study equilibria that arise when one of the CPs colludes with the ISP. We also study two dynamic game models and study the convergence of prices to the equilibrium values."

    title "net neutrality and quality of service"
    abstract "2010 has witnessed many public consultations around the world concerning Net neutrality. A second legislative phase that may follow, could involve various structural changes in the Internet. The status that the Internet access has in Europe as a universal service evolves as the level of quality of service (QoS) to be offered improves. If guarantees on QoS are to be imposed, as requested by several economic actors, it would require introducing new indicators of quality of services, as well as regulation legislation and monitoring of the offered levels of QoS. This tendency in Europe may change the nature of the Internet from a best effort network to, perhaps, a more expensive one, that offers guaranteed performance. This paper presents an overview of the above issues as well as an overview of recent research on net-neutrality, with an emphasis on game theoretical approaches."

    abstract "Aloha games study the transmission probabilities of a group of non-cooperative users which share a channel to transmit via the slotted Aloha protocol. This paper extends the Aloha games to spatial reuse scenarios, and studies the system equilibrium and performance. Specifically, fixed point theory and order theory are used to prove the existence of a least fixed point as the unique Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game and the optimal choice of all players. The Krasovskii's method is used to construct a Lyapunov function and obtain the conditions to examine the stability of the NE. Simulations show that the theories derived are applicable to large-scale distributed systems of complicated network topologies. An empirical relationship between the network connectivity and the achievable total throughput is finally obtained through simulations."

    title "the robust price of anarchy of altruistic games"
    abstract "We study the inefficiency of equilibria for various classes of games when players are (partially) altruistic. We model altruistic behavior by assuming that player i's perceived cost is a convex combination of 1-\alpha_i times his direct cost and \alpha_i times the social cost. Tuning the parameters \alpha_i allows smooth interpolation between purely selfish and purely altruistic behavior. Within this framework, we study altruistic extensions of linear congestion games, fair cost-sharing games and valid utility games. #R##N#We derive (tight) bounds on the price of anarchy of these games for several solution concepts. Thereto, we suitably adapt the smoothness notion introduced by Roughgarden and show that it captures the essential properties to determine the robust price of anarchy of these games. Our bounds show that for congestion games and cost-sharing games, the worst-case robust price of anarchy increases with increasing altruism, while for valid utility games, it remains constant and is not affected by altruism. However, the increase in the price of anarchy is not a universal phenomenon: for symmetric singleton linear congestion games, we derive a bound on the pure price of anarchy that decreases as the level of altruism increases. Since the bound is also strictly lower than the robust price of anarchy, it exhibits a natural example in which Nash equilibria are more efficient than more permissive notions of equilibrium."

    title "stable nash equilibria of medium access games under symmetric socially altruistic behavior"
    abstract "We consider the effects of altruistic behavior on random medium access control (slotted ALOHA) for local area communication networks. For an idealized, synchronously iterative, two-player game with asymmetric player demands, we find a Hamiltonian governing the Jacobi dynamics under purely altruistic behavior. Though the positions of the interior Nash equilibrium points do not change in the presence of altruistic behavior, the nature of their local asymptotic stability does. There is a region of partially altruistic behavior for which neither interior Nash equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable. Also, for a power control game with a single Nash equilibrium, we show how its stability changes as a function of the altruism parameter. Variations of these altruistic game frameworks are discussed considering power (instead of throughput) based costs and linear utility functions."

    title "altruism in atomic congestion games"
    abstract "This paper studies the effects of introducing altruistic agents into atomic congestion games. Altruistic behavior is modeled by a trade-off between selfish and social objectives. In particular, we assume agents optimize a linear combination of personal delay of a strategy and the resulting increase in social cost. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games with player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the Nash equilibria of these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of sequential best-response dynamics. Previous work shows that for symmetric singleton games with convex delays Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. For concave delay functions we observe that there are games without Nash equilibria and provide a polynomial time algorithm to decide existence for symmetric singleton games with arbitrary delay functions. Our algorithm can be extended to compute best and worst Nash equilibria if they exist. For more general congestion games existence becomes NP-hard to decide, even for symmetric network games with quadratic delay functions. Perhaps surprisingly, if all delay functions are linear, then there is always a Nash equilibrium in any congestion game with altruists and any better-response dynamics converges. In addition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario in which a central altruistic institution can motivate agents to act altruistically. We provide constructive and hardness results for finding the minimum number of altruists to stabilize an optimal congestion profile and more general mechanisms to incentivize agents to adopt favorable behavior."

    title "public wi fi monetization via advertising"
    abstract "The proliferation of public Wi-Fi hotspots has brought new business potentials for Wi-Fi networks, which carry a significant amount of global mobile data traffic today. In this paper, we propose a novel Wi-Fi monetization model for venue owners (VOs) deploying public Wi-Fi hotspots, where the VOs can generate revenue by providing two different Wi-Fi access schemes for mobile users (MUs): (i) the premium access, in which MUs directly pay VOs for their Wi-Fi usage, and (ii) the advertising sponsored access, in which MUs watch advertisements in exchange of the free usage of Wi-Fi. VOs sell their ad spaces to advertisers (ADs) via an ad platform, and share the ADs' payments with the ad platform. We formulate the economic interactions among the ad platform, VOs, MUs, and ADs as a three-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the ad platform announces its advertising revenue sharing policy. In Stage II, VOs determine the Wi-Fi prices (for MUs) and advertising prices (for ADs). In Stage III, MUs make access choices and ADs purchase advertising spaces. We analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically, and our analysis shows the following useful observations. First, the ad platform's advertising revenue sharing policy in Stage I will affect only the VOs' Wi-Fi prices but not the VOs' advertising prices in Stage II. Second, both the VOs' Wi-Fi prices and advertising prices are non-decreasing in the advertising concentration level and non-increasing in the MU visiting frequency. Numerical results further show that the VOs are capable of generating large revenues through mainly providing one type of Wi-Fi access (the premium access or advertising sponsored access), depending on their advertising concentration levels and MU visiting frequencies."

    title "efficient and scalable distributed autonomous spatial aloha networks via local leader election"
    abstract "This paper uses a spatial Aloha model to describe a distributed autonomous wireless network in which a group of transmit-receive pairs (users) shares a common collision channel via slotted-Aloha-like random access. The objective of this study is to develop an intelligent algorithm to be embedded into the transceivers so that all users know how to self-tune their medium access probability (MAP) to achieve overall Pareto optimality in terms of network throughput under spatial reuse while maintaining network stability. While the optimal solution requires each user to have complete information about the network, our proposed algorithm only requires users to have local information. The fundamental of our algorithm is that the users will first self-organize into a number of non-overlapping neighborhoods, and the user with the maximum node degree in each neighborhood is elected as the local leader (LL). Each LL then adjusts its MAP according to a parameter R which indicates the radio intensity level in its neighboring region, whereas the remaining users in the neighborhood simply follow the same MAP value. We show that by ensuring R less than or equal to 2 at the LLs, the stability of the entire network can be assured even when each user only has partial network information. For practical implementation, we propose each LL to use R=2 as the constant reference signal to its built-in proportional and integral controller. The settings of the control parameters are discussed and we validate through simulations that the proposed method is able to achieve close-to-Pareto-front throughput."

    title "exploiting social tie structure for cooperative wireless networking a social group utility maximization framework"
    abstract "In this paper, we develop a social group utility maximization (SGUM) framework for cooperative wireless networking that takes into account both social relationships and physical coupling among users. We show that this framework provides rich modeling flexibility and spans the continuum between non-cooperative game and network utility maximization (NUM) -- two traditionally disjoint paradigms for network optimization. Based on this framework, we study three important applications of SGUM, in database assisted spectrum access, power control, and random access control, respectively. For the case of database assisted spectrum access, we show that the SGUM game is a potential game and always admits a socially-aware Nash equilibrium (SNE). We develop a randomized distributed spectrum access algorithm that can asymptotically converge to the optimal SNE, derive upper bounds on the convergence time, and also quantify the trade-off between the performance and convergence time of the algorithm. We further show that the performance gap of SNE by the algorithm from the NUM solution decreases as the strength of social ties among users increases and the performance gap is zero when the strengths of social ties among users reach the maximum values. For the cases of power control and random access control, we show that there exists a unique SNE. Furthermore, as the strength of social ties increases from the minimum to the maximum, a player's SNE strategy migrates from the Nash equilibrium strategy in a standard non-cooperative game to the socially-optimal strategy in network utility maximization. Furthermore, we show that the SGUM framework can be generalized to take into account both positive and negative social ties among users and can be a useful tool for studying network security problems."

    title "two sided matching based cooperative spectrum sharing"
    abstract "Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) can effectively improve the spectrum efficiency and alleviate the spectrum scarcity, by allowing unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to access the licensed spectrum of primary users (PUs) opportunistically. Cooperative spectrum sharing is a new promising paradigm to provide necessary  incentives  for both PUs and SUs in dynamic spectrum access. The key idea is that SUs relay the traffic of PUs in exchange for the access time on the PUs&#8217; licensed spectrum. In this paper, we formulate the cooperative spectrum sharing between multiple PUs and multiple SUs as a  two-sided market , and study the market equilibrium under both complete and incomplete information. First, we characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the market equilibrium. We analytically show that there may exist multiple market equilibria, among which there is always a unique   Pareto-optimal  equilibrium for PUs (called    $\sf{PU\hbox{-}Optimal\hbox{-}EQ}$      ), in which  every  PU achieves a utility no worse than in any other equilibrium. Then, we show that under complete information, the unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium    $\sf{PU\hbox{-}Optimal\hbox{-}EQ}$       can always be achieved despite the competition among PUs; whereas, under incomplete information, the    $\sf{PU\hbox{-}Optimal\hbox{-}EQ}$       may not be achieved due to the mis-representations of SUs (in reporting their private information). Regarding this, we further study the worse-case equilibrium for PUs, and characterize a  Robust   equilibrium for PUs (called   $\sf{PU\hbox{-}Robust\hbox{-}EQ}$      ), which provides  every  PU a guaranteed utility under all possible mis-representation behaviors of SUs. Numerical results show that in a typical network where the number of PUs and SUs are different, the performance gap between   $\sf{PU\hbox{-}Optimal\hbox{-}EQ}$       and    $\sf{PU\hbox{-}Robust\hbox{-}EQ}$       is quite small (e.g., less than 10&#160;percent in the simulations)."

    abstract "Crowdsourced wireless community networks can effectively alleviate the limited coverage issue of Wi-Fi access points (APs), by encouraging individuals (users) to share their private residential Wi-Fi APs with others. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive economic analysis for such a crowdsourced network, with the particular focus on the users&#8217; behavior analysis and the community network operator&#8217;s pricing design. Specifically, we formulate the interactions between the network operator and users as a two-layer Stackelberg model, where the operator determining the pricing scheme in Layer I, and then users determining their Wi-Fi sharing schemes in Layer II. First, we analyze the user behavior in Layer II via a two-stage membership selection and network access game, for both small-scale networks and large-scale networks. Then, we design a partial price differentiation scheme for the operator in Layer I, which generalizes both the complete price differentiation scheme and the single pricing scheme (i.e., no price differentiation). We show that the proposed partial pricing scheme can achieve a good tradeoff between the revenue and the implementation complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that when using the partial pricing scheme with only two prices, we can increase the operator&#8217;s revenue up to 124.44 percent comparing with the single pricing scheme, and can achieve an average of 80 percent of the maximum operator revenue under the complete price differentiation scheme."

    abstract "Geo-location database-assisted TV white space network reduces the need of energy-intensive processes (such as spectrum sensing), hence can achieve green cognitive communication effectively. The success of such a network relies on a proper business model that provides incentives for all parties involved. In this paper, we propose MINE GOLD (a Model of INformation markEt for GeO-Location Database), which enables databases to sell the spectrum information to unlicensed white space devices (WSDs) for profit. Specifically, we focus on an oligopoly information market with multiple databases, and study the interactions among databases and WSDs using a two-stage hierarchical model. In Stage I, databases compete to sell information to WSDs by optimizing their information prices. In Stage II, each WSD decides whether and from which database to purchase the information, to maximize his benefit of using the TV white space. We first characterize how the WSDs' purchasing behaviors dynamically evolve, and what is the equilibrium point under fixed information prices from the databases. We then analyze how the system parameters and the databases' pricing decisions affect the market equilibrium, and what is the equilibrium of the database price competition. Our numerical results show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the databases' aggregate revenue is not monotonic with the number of databases. Moreover, numerical results show that a large degree of positive network externality would improve the databases' revenues and the system performance."

    title "efficient and fair collaborative mobile internet access"
    abstract "The surging global mobile data traffic challenges the economic viability of cellular networks and calls for innovative solutions to reduce the network congestion and improve user experience. In this context, user-provided networks (UPNs), where mobile users share their Internet access by exploiting their diverse network resources and needs, turn out to be very promising. Heterogeneous users with advanced handheld devices can form connections in a distributed fashion and unleash dormant network resources at the network edge. However, the success of such services heavily depends on users' willingness to contribute their resources, such as network access and device battery energy. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for UPN services and design a bargaining-based distributed incentive mechanism to ensure users participation. The proposed mechanism determines the resources that each user should contribute in order to maximise the aggregate data rate in UPN, and fairly allocate the benefit among the users. The numerical results verify that the service can always improve performance, and such improvement increases with the diversity of the users' resources. Quantitatively, it can reach an average 30% increase of the total served traffic for a typical scenario even with only 6 mobile users."

Rather than assuming &#8220;by rule&#8221; conformance to a protocol designed to regulate packet-flow rates (e.g., CSMA windowing), we begin with a noncooperative game framework and build a dynamic altruism term into the net utility. The effects of altruism are analyzed at Nash equilibrium for both the ALOHA and CSMA frameworks in the quasistationary (fictitious play) regime. We consider either power or throughput based costs of networking, and the cases of identical or heterogeneous (independent) users/players. In a numerical study we consider diverse players, and we see that the effects of altruism for similar players can be beneficial in the presence of significant congestion, but excessive altruism may lead to underuse of the channel when demand is low."

    abstract "A database-assisted TV white space network can achieve the goal of green cognitive communication by effectively reducing the energy consumption in cognitive communications. The success of such a novel network relies on a proper business model that provides incentives for all parties involved. In this paper, we propose an integrated spectrum and information market for a database-assisted TV white space network, where the geo-location database serves as both the spectrum market platform and the information market platform. We study the interactions among the database, the spectrum licensee, and unlicensed users by modelling the system as a three-stage sequential decision process. In Stage I, the database and the licensee negotiate regarding the commission for the licensee to use the spectrum market platform. In Stage II, the database and the licensee compete for selling information or channels to unlicensed users. In Stage III, unlicensed users determine whether they should buy exclusive usage right of licensed channels from the licensee or information regarding unlicensed channels from the database. Analyzing such a three-stage model is challenging due to the co-existence of both positive and negative network externalities in the information market. Despite of this, we are able to characterize how the network externalities affect the equilibrium behaviors of all parties involved. We analytically show that in this integrated market, the licensee can never get a market share more than half. Our numerical results further show that the proposed integrated market can improve the network profit up to 87%, compared with a pure information market."

This behavior is modeled as a modulated white noise term, in addition to the greedy term, creating a diffusion process modeling the game. We observe that when player's modulate with their throughput, a more efficient exploration of play-space results, and so finding a Pareto equilibrium is more likely over a given interval of time."

    title "combining spot and futures markets a hybrid market approach to dynamic spectrum access"
    abstract "Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a new paradigm of secondary spectrum utilization and sharing. It allows unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to exploit the under-utilized radio spectrum licensed to primary users opportunistically. Market mechanism is a widely-used promising means to regulate the consuming behaviours of users and, hence, achieve the efficient allocation and consumption of limited resources. In this paper, we propose and study a hybrid secondary spectrum market consisting of both the futures market and the spot market, in which SUs (buyers) purchase under-utilized licensed spectrum from a primary spectrum regulator (PR), either through predefined contracts via the futures market, or through spot transactions via the spot market. We focus on the optimal spectrum allocation among SUs in an exogenous hybrid market that maximizes the secondary spectrum utilization efficiency. The problem is challenging due to the stochasticity and asymmetry of network information. To solve this problem, we first derive an o?ff-line optimal allocation policy that maximizes the ex-ante expected spectrum utilization efficiency based on the stochastic distribution of network information. We then propose an on-line VCG auction that determines the real-time allocation and pricing of every spectrum based on the realized network information and the derived allocation policy. We further show that with the spatial frequency reuse, the proposed VCG auction is NP-hard; hence, it is not suitable for on-line implementation, especially in a large-scale market. To this end, we propose a heuristics approach based on an on-line VCG-like mechanism with polynomial-time complexity, and further characterize the corresponding performance loss bound analytically. We finally provide extensive numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions."

    title "achieving an efficient and fair equilibrium through taxation"
    abstract "It is well known that a game equilibrium can be far from efficient or fair, due to the misalignment between individual and social objectives. The focus of this paper is to design a new mechanism framework that induces an efficient and fair equilibrium in a general class of games. To achieve this goal, we propose a taxation framework, which first imposes a tax on each player based on the perceived payoff (income), and then redistributes the collected tax to other players properly. By turning the tax rate, this framework spans the continuum space between strategic interactions (of selfish players) and altruistic interactions (of unselfish players), hence provides rich modeling possibilities. The key challenge in the design of this framework is the proper taxing rule (i.e., the tax exemption and tax rate) that induces the desired equilibrium in a wide range of games. First, we propose a flat tax rate (i.e., a single tax rate for all players), which is necessary and sufficient for achieving an efficient equilibrium in any static strategic game with common knowledge. Then, we provide several tax exemption rules that achieve some typical fairness criterions (such as the Max-min fairness) at the equilibrium. We further illustrate the implementation of the framework in the game of Prisoners' Dilemma."
