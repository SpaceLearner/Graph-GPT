    title "dynamic social balance and convergent appraisals via homophily and influence mechanisms"
    abstract "Social balance theory describes allowable and forbidden configurations of the topologies of signed directed social appraisal networks. In this paper, we propose two discrete-time dynamical systems that explain how an appraisal network evolves towards social balance from an initially unbalanced configuration. These two models are based on two different socio-psychological mechanisms respectively: the homophily mechanism and the influence mechanism. Our main theoretical contribution is a comprehensive analysis for both models in three steps. First, we establish the well-posedness and bounded evolution of the interpersonal appraisals. Second, we characterize the set of equilibrium points as follows: for both models, each equilibrium network is composed by an arbitrary number of complete subgraphs satisfying structural balance. Third, under a technical condition, we establish convergence of the appraisal network to a final equilibrium network satisfying structural balance. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we provide numerical evidence that our technical condition for convergence holds for generic initial conditions in both models. Finally, adopting the homophily-based model, we present numerical results on the mediation and globalization of local conflicts, the competition for allies, and the asymptotic formation of a single versus two factions."

    title "finite time convergent gossiping"
    abstract "Gossip algorithms are widely used in modern distributed systems, with applications ranging from sensor networks and peer-to-peer networks to mobile vehicle networks and social networks. A tremendous research effort has been devoted to analyzing and improving the asymptotic rate of convergence for gossip algorithms. In this work we study finite-time convergence of deterministic gossiping. We show that there exists a symmetric gossip algorithm that converges in finite time if and only if the number of network nodes is a power of two, while there always exists an asymmetric gossip algorithm with finite-time convergence, independent of the number of nodes. For    $n=2^m$   nodes, we prove that a fastest convergence can be reached in    $nm=n\log_2 n$   node updates via symmetric gossiping. On the other hand, under asymmetric gossip among   $n=2^m+r$   nodes with   $0\leq r   , it takes at least   $mn+2r$   node updates for achieving finite-time convergence. It is also shown that the existence of finite-time convergent gossiping often imposes strong structural requirements on the underlying interaction graph. Finally, we apply our results to gossip algorithms in quantum networks, where the goal is to control the state of a quantum system via pairwise interactions. We show that finite-time convergence is never possible for such systems."

    title "visualizing structural balance in signed networks"
    abstract "Network visualization has established as a key complement to network analysis since the large variety of existing network layouts are able to graphically highlight different properties of networks. However, signed networks, i.e., networks whose edges are labeled as friendly (positive) or antagonistic (negative), are target of few of such layouts and none, to our knowledge, is able to show structural balance, i.e., the tendency of cycles towards including an even number of negative edges, which is a well-known theory for studying friction and polarization. #R##N#In this work we present Structural-balance-viz: a novel visualization method showing whether a connected signed network is balanced or not and, in the latter case, how close the network is to be balanced. Structural-balance-viz exploits spectral computations of the signed Laplacian matrix to place network's nodes in a Cartesian coordinate system resembling a balance (a scale). Moreover, it uses edge coloring and bundling to distinguish positive and negative interactions. The proposed visualization method has characteristics desirable in a variety of network analysis tasks: Structural-balance-viz is able to provide indications of balance/polarization of the whole network and of each node, to identify two factions of nodes on the basis of their polarization, and to show their cumulative characteristics. Moreover, the layout is reproducible and easy to compare. Structural-balance-viz is validated over synthetic-generated networks and applied to a real-world dataset about political debates confirming that it is able to provide meaningful interpretations."

    title "discrete time polar opinion dynamics with susceptibility"
    abstract "This paper considers a discrete-time opinion dynamics model in which each individual's susceptibility to being influenced by others is dependent on her current opinion. We assume that the social network has time-varying topology and that the opinions are scalars on a continuous interval. We first propose a general opinion dynamics model based on the DeGroot model, with a general function to describe the functional dependence of each individual's susceptibility on her own opinion, and show that this general model is analogous to the Friedkin-Johnsen model, which assumes a constant susceptibility for each individual. We then consider two specific functions in which the individual's susceptibility depends on the \emph{polarity} of her opinion, and provide motivating social examples. First, we consider stubborn positives, who have reduced susceptibility if their opinions are at one end of the interval and increased susceptibility if their opinions are at the opposite end. A court jury is used as a motivating example. Second, we consider stubborn neutrals, who have reduced susceptibility when their opinions are in the middle of the spectrum, and our motivating examples are social networks discussing established social norms or institutionalized behavior. For each specific susceptibility model, we establish the initial and graph topology conditions in which consensus is reached, and develop necessary and sufficient conditions on the initial conditions for the final consensus value to be at either extreme of the opinion interval. Simulations are provided to show the effects of the susceptibility function when compared to the DeGroot model."

    title "persistent flows and non reciprocal interactions in deterministic networks"
    abstract "This paper studies deterministic consensus networks with discrete-time dynamics under persistent flows and non-reciprocal agent interactions. An arc describing the interaction strength between two agents is said to be persistent if its weight function has an infinite $l_1$ norm. We discuss two balance conditions on the interactions between agents which generalize the arc-balance and cut-balance conditions in the literature respectively. The proposed conditions require that such a balance should be satisfied over each time window of a fixed length instead of at each time instant. We prove that in both cases global consensus is reached if and only if the persistent graph, which consists of all the persistent arcs, contains a directed spanning tree. The convergence rates of the system to consensus are also provided in terms of the interactions between agents having taken place. The results are obtained under a weak condition without assuming the existence of a positive lower bound of all the nonzero weights of arcs and are compared with the existing results. Illustrative examples are provided to show the critical importance of the nontrivial lower boundedness of the self-confidence of the agents."

    title "differential inequalities in multi agent coordination and opinion dynamics modeling"
    abstract "Abstract   Many distributed algorithms for multi-agent coordination employ the simple averaging dynamics, referred to as the  Laplacian flow . Besides the standard consensus protocols, examples include, but are not limited to, algorithms for aggregation and containment control, target surrounding, distributed optimization and models of opinion formation in social groups. In spite of their similarities, each of these algorithms has been studied using separate mathematical techniques. In this paper, we show that stability and convergence of many coordination algorithms involving the Laplacian flow dynamics follow from the general  consensus dichotomy  property of a special differential inequality. The consensus dichotomy implies that any solution to the differential inequality is either unbounded or converges to a consensus equilibrium. In this paper, we establish the dichotomy criteria for differential inequalities and illustrate their applications to multi-agent coordination and opinion dynamics modeling."

    title "the role of persistent graphs in the agreement seeking of social networks"
    abstract "This paper investigates the role persistent arcs play for a social network to reach a global belief agreement under discrete-time or continuous-time evolution. Each (directed) arc in the underlying communication graph is assumed to be associated with a time-dependent weight function which describes the strength of the information flow from one node to another. An arc is said to be persistent if its weight function has infinite $\mathscr{L}_1$ or $\ell_1$ norm for continuous-time or discrete-time belief evolutions, respectively. The graph that consists of all persistent arcs is called the persistent graph of the underlying network. Three necessary and sufficient conditions on agreement or $\epsilon$-agreement are established, by which we prove that the persistent graph fully determines the convergence to a common opinion in social networks. It is shown how the convergence rates explicitly depend on the diameter of the persistent graph. The results adds to the understanding of the fundamentals behind global agreements, as it is only persistent arcs that contribute to the convergence."

    title "the convergence of bird flocking"
    abstract "We bound the time it takes for a group of birds to reach steady state in a standard flocking model. We prove that (i) within single exponential time fragmentation ceases and each bird settles on a fixed flying direction; (ii) the flocking network converges only after a number of steps that is an iterated exponential of height logarithmic in the number of birds. We also prove the highly surprising result that this bound is optimal. The model directs the birds to adjust their velocities repeatedly by averaging them with their neighbors within a fixed radius. The model is deterministic, but we show that it can tolerate a reasonable amount of stochastic or even adversarial noise. Our methods are highly general and we speculate that the results extend to a wider class of models based on undirected flocking networks, whether defined metrically or topologically. This work introduces new techniques of broader interest, including the &#34;flight net,&#34; the &#34;iterated spectral shift,&#34; and a certain &#34;residue-clearing&#34; argument in circuit complexity."

    title "distributed consensus algorithms in sensor networks quantized data and random link failures"
    abstract "The paper studies the problem of distributed average consensus in sensor networks with quantized data and random link failures. To achieve consensus, dither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When the quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels), stochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with probability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that the meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link weight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study dithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is bounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded quantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the supremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is accomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components: one along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to the consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale and supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the excursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the excursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use these probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore tradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization steps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy $\epsilon$ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer design with a numerical study."

    title "modulus consensus in discrete time signed networks and properties of special recurrent inequalities"
    abstract "Recently the dynamics of signed networks, where the ties among the agents can be both positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) have attracted substantial attention of the research community. Examples of such networks are models of opinion dynamics over signed graphs, recently introduced by Altafini (2012,2013) and extended to discrete-time case by Meng et al. (2014). It has been shown that under mild connectivity assumptions these protocols provide the convergence of opinions in absolute value, whereas their signs may differ. This &#34;modulus consensus&#34; may correspond to the polarization of the opinions (or bipartite consensus, including the usual consensus as a special case), or their convergence to zero. In this paper, we demonstrate that the phenomenon of modulus consensus in the discrete-time Altafini model is a manifestation of a more general and profound fact, regarding the solutions of a special recurrent inequality. Although such a recurrent inequality does not provide the uniqueness of a solution, it can be shown that, under some natural assumptions, each of its bounded solutions has a limit and, moreover, converges to consensus. A similar property has previously been established for special continuous-time differential inequalities (Proskurnikov, Cao, 2016). Besides analysis of signed networks, we link the consensus properties of recurrent inequalities to the convergence analysis of distributed optimization algorithms and the problems of Schur stability of substochastic matrices."

    title "structural balance and opinion separation in trust mistrust social networks"
    abstract "Structural balance theory has been developed in sociology and psychology to explain how interacting agents, for example, countries, political parties, opinionated individuals, with mixed trust and mistrust relationships evolve into polarized camps. Recent results have shown that structural balance is necessary for polarization in networks with fixed, strongly connected neighbor relationships when the opinion dynamics are described by DeGroot-type averaging rules. We develop this line of research in this paper in two steps. First, we consider fixed, not necessarily strongly connected, neighbor relationships. It is shown that if the network includes a strongly connected subnetwork containing mistrust, which influences the rest of the network, then no opinion clustering is possible when that subnetwork is not structurally balanced; all of the opinions become neutralized in the end. In contrast, it is shown that when that subnetwork is indeed structurally balanced, the agents of the subnetwork evolve into two polarized camps and the opinions of all other agents in the network spread between these two polarized opinions. Second, we consider time-varying neighbor relationships. We show that the opinion separation criteria carry over if the conditions for fixed graphs are extended to joint graphs. The results are developed for both discrete-time and continuous-time models."

    title "how agreement and disagreement evolve over random dynamic networks"
    abstract "The dynamics of an agreement protocol interacting with a disagreement process over a common random network is considered. The model can represent the spreading of true and false information over a communication network, the propagation of faults in a large-scale control system, or the development of trust and mistrust in a society. At each time instance and with a given probability, a pair of network nodes are selected to interact. At random each of the nodes then updates its state towards the state of the other node (attraction), away from the other node (repulsion), or sticks to its current state (neglect). Agreement convergence and disagreement divergence results are obtained for various strengths of the updates for both symmetric and asymmetric update rules. Impossibility theorems show that a specific level of attraction is required for almost sure asymptotic agreement and a specific level of repulsion is required for almost sure asymptotic disagreement. A series of sufficient and/or necessary conditions are then established for agreement convergence or disagreement divergence. In particular, under symmetric updates, a critical convergence measure in the attraction and repulsion update strength is found, in the sense that the asymptotic property of the network state evolution transits from agreement convergence to disagreement divergence when this measure goes from negative to positive. The result can be interpreted as a tight bound on how much bad action needs to be injected in a dynamic network in order to consistently steer its overall behavior away from consensus."

This trend was enabled by the introduction of new mathematical models describing dynamics of social groups, the advancement in complex networks theory and multi-agent systems, and the development of modern computational tools for big data analysis. The aim of this tutorial is to highlight a novel chapter of control theory, dealing with applications to social systems, to the attention of the broad research community. This paper is the first part of the tutorial, and it is focused on the most classical models of social dynamics and on their relations to the recent achievements in multi-agent systems."

The competitive information spread is formulated as a zero-sum game between the competitive information sources, whose pure Nash equilibrium is demonstrated to exist. The derived Nash equilibrium depends on the innate opinions, social network topology and parameters of confirmation bias. Nash equilibriums in the scenarios of neutral and extremal group of innate opinions are also investigated.

    title "distributed sensor localization in random environments using minimal number of anchor nodes"
    abstract "The paper introduces DILOC, a distributed, iterative algorithm to locate M sensors (with unknown locations) in Rm, m ges 1, with respect to a minimal number of m + 1 anchors with known locations. The sensors and anchors, nodes in the network, exchange data with their neighbors only; no centralized data processing or communication occurs, nor is there a centralized fusion center to compute the sensors' locations. DILOC uses the barycentric coordinates of a node with respect to its neighbors; these coordinates are computed using the Cayley-Menger determinants, i.e., the determinants of matrices of internode distances. We show convergence of DILOC by associating with it an absorbing Markov chain whose absorbing states are the states of the anchors. We introduce a stochastic approximation version extending DILOC to random environments, i.e., when the communications among nodes is noisy, the communication links among neighbors may fail at random times, and the internodes distances are subject to errors. We show a.s. convergence of the modified DILOC and characterize the error between the true values of the sensors' locations and their final estimates given by DILOC. Numerical studies illustrate DILOC under a variety of deterministic and random operating conditions."

    abstract "We consider continuous-time consensus seeking systems whose time-dependent interactions are cut-balanced, in the following sense: if a group of agents influences the remaining ones, the former group is also influenced by the remaining ones by at least a proportional amount. Models involving symmetric interconnections and models in which a weighted average of the agent values is conserved are special cases. We prove that such systems always converge. We give a sufficient condition on the evolving interaction topology for the limit values of two agents to be the same. Conversely, we show that if our condition is not satisfied, then these limits are generically different. These results allow treating systems where the agent interactions are a priori unknown, e.g., random or determined endogenously by the agent values. We also derive corresponding results for discrete-time systems."

    title "opinion dynamics in social networks with hostile camps consensus vs polarization"
    abstract "Most of the distributed protocols for multi-agent consensus assume that the agents are mutually cooperative and &#8220;trustful,&#8221; and so the couplings among the agents bring the values of their states closer. Opinion dynamics in social groups, however, require beyond these conventional models due to ubiquitous competition and distrust between some pairs of agents, which are usually characterized by repulsive couplings and may lead to clustering of the opinions. A simple yet insightful model of opinion dynamics with both attractive and repulsive couplings was proposed recently by C. Altafini, who examined first-order consensus algorithms over static signed graphs. This protocol establishes modulus consensus, where the opinions become the same in modulus but may differ in signs. In this paper, we extend the modulus consensus model to the case where the network topology is an arbitrary time-varying signed graph and prove reaching modulus consensus under mild sufficient conditions of uniform connectivity of the graph. For cut-balanced graphs, not only sufficient, but also necessary conditions for modulus consensus are given."

    abstract "We consider continuous-time consensus systems whose interactions satisfy a form or reciprocity that is not instantaneous, but happens over time. We show that these systems have certain desirable properties: They always converge independently of the specific interactions taking place and there exist simple conditions on the interactions for two agents to converge to the same value. This was until now only known for systems with instantaneous reciprocity. These result are of particular relevance when analyzing systems where interactions are a priori unknown, being for example endogenously determined or random. We apply our results to an instance of such systems."
