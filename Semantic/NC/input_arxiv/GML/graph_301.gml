    title "mosden a scalable mobile collaborative platform for opportunistic sensing applications"
    abstract "Mobile smartphones along with embedded sensors have become an efficient enabler for various mobile applications including opportunistic sensing. The hi-tech advances in smartphones are opening up a world of possibilities. This paper proposes a mobile collaborative platform called MOSDEN that enables and supports opportunistic sensing at run time. MOSDEN captures and shares sensor data across multiple apps, smartphones and users. MOSDEN supports the emerging trend of separating sensors from application-specific processing, storing and sharing. MOSDEN promotes reuse and re-purposing of sensor data hence reducing the efforts in developing novel opportunistic sensing applications. MOSDEN has been implemented on Android-based smartphones and tablets. Experimental evaluations validate the scalability and energy efficiency of MOSDEN and its suitability towards real world applications. The results of evaluation and lessons learned are presented and discussed in this paper."

    title "when things matter a data centric view of the internet of things"
    abstract "With the recent advances in radio-frequency identification (RFID), low-cost wireless sensor devices, and Web technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) approach has gained momentum in connecting everyday objects to the Internet and facilitating machine-to-human and machine-to-machine communication with the physical world. While IoT offers the capability to connect and integrate both digital and physical entities, enabling a whole new class of applications and services, several significant challenges need to be addressed before these applications and services can be fully realized. A fundamental challenge centers around managing IoT data, typically produced in dynamic and volatile environments, which is not only extremely large in scale and volume, but also noisy, and continuous. This article surveys the main techniques and state-of-the-art research efforts in IoT from data-centric perspectives, including data stream processing, data storage models, complex event processing, and searching in IoT. Open research issues for IoT data management are also discussed."

    title "activities context and ubiquitous computing"
    abstract "Context and context-awareness provides computing environments with the ability to usefully adapt the services or information they provide. It is the ability to implicitly sense and automatically derive the user needs that separates context-aware applications from traditionally designed applications, and this makes them more attentive, responsive, and aware of their user's identity, and their user's environment. This paper argues that context-aware applications capable of supporting complex, cognitive activities can be built from a model of context called Activity-Centric Context. A conceptual model of Activity-Centric context is presented. The model is illustrated via a detailed example."

    title "investigating iot middleware platforms for smart application development"
    abstract "With the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the data generated through these devices is also increasing. By 2030, it is been predicted that the number of IoT devices will exceed the number of human beings on earth. This gives rise to the requirement of middleware platform that can manage IoT devices, intelligently store and process gigantic data generated for building smart applications such as Smart Cities, Smart Healthcare, Smart Industry, and others. At present, market is overwhelming with the number of IoT middleware platforms with specific features. This raises one of the most serious and least discussed challenge for application developer to choose suitable platform for their application development. Across the literature, very little attempt is done in classifying or comparing IoT middleware platforms for the applications. This paper categorizes IoT platforms into four categories namely-publicly traded, open source, developer friendly and end-to-end connectivity. Some of the popular middleware platforms in each category are investigated based on general IoT architecture. Comparison of IoT middleware platforms in each category, based on basic, sensing, communication and application development features is presented. This study can be useful for IoT application developers to select the most appropriate platform according to their application requirement."

    title "internet of things iot a vision architectural elements and future directions"
    abstract "Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies such as RFID tags and readers, near field communication (NFC) devices and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community."

    title "sensor discovery and configuration framework for the internet of things paradigm"
    abstract "Internet of Things (IoT) will comprise billions of devices that can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate. The data generated by the Internet of Things are valuable and have the potential to drive innovative and novel applications. The data streams coming from these devices will challenge the traditional approaches to data management and contribute to the emerging paradigm of big data. One of the most challenging tasks before collecting and processing data from these devices (e.g. sensors) is discovering and configuring the sensors and the associated data streams. In this paper, we propose a tool called SmartLink that can be used to discover and configure sensors. Specifically, SmartLink, is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity (e.g. different communication protocols, communication sequences, capabilities). SmartLink establishes the direct communication between the sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware. We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plugin architecture. Our prototype tool is developed on the Android platform. We evaluate the significance of our approach by discovering and configuring 52 different types of Libelium sensors."

    title "analytics for the internet of things a survey"
    abstract "The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a world-wide, interconnected network of smart physical entities. These physical entities generate a large amount of data in operation and as the IoT gains momentum in terms of deployment, the combined scale of those data seems destined to continue to grow. Increasingly, applications for the IoT involve analytics. Data analytics is the process of deriving knowledge from data, generating value like actionable insights from them. This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics. This taxonomy provides us with insights on the appropriateness of analytical techniques, which in turn shapes a survey of enabling technology and infrastructure for IoT analytics. Finally, we look at some tradeoffs for analytics in the IoT that can shape future research."

    title "big data analytics in future internet of things"
    abstract "Current research on Internet of Things (IoT) mainly focuses on how to enable general objects to see, hear, and smell the physical world for themselves, and make them connected to share the observations. In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both the physical world by themselves. On the other hand, the future IoT will be highly populated by large numbers of heterogeneous networked embedded devices, which are generating massive or big data in an explosive fashion. Although there is a consensus among almost everyone on the great importance of big data analytics in IoT, to date, limited results, especially the mathematical foundations, are obtained. These practical needs impels us to propose a systematic tutorial on the development of effective algorithms for big data analytics in future IoT, which are grouped into four classes: 1) heterogeneous data processing, 2) nonlinear data processing, 3) high-dimensional data processing, and 4) distributed and parallel data processing. We envision that the presented research is offered as a mere baby step in a potentially fruitful research direction. We hope that this article, with interdisciplinary perspectives, will stimulate more interests in research and development of practical and effective algorithms for specific IoT applications, to enable smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning."

    title "the emerging internet of things marketplace from an industrial perspective a survey"
    abstract "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network consisting of Internet-connected objects, such as Radio frequency identifications, sensors, actuators, as well as other instruments and smart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the future Internet. Over the last decade, we have seen a large number of the IoT solutions developed by start-ups, small and medium enterprises, large corporations, academic research institutes (such as universities), and private and public research organizations making their way into the market. In this paper, we survey over one hundred IoT smart solutions in the marketplace and examine them closely in order to identify the technologies used, functionalities, and applications. Based on the application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under five different categories: 1) smart wearable; 2) smart home; 3) smart city; 4) smart environment; and 5) smart enterprise. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for future research in the IoT and to motivate and inspire further developments. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing research and suggests a number of potentially significant research directions."

    title "comparing properties of massively multiplayer online worlds and the internet of things"
    abstract "A virtual world engine at the massively multiplayer scale is a massively multiplayer online world (MMOW); one thing virtual world engines realized when going into the scale of MMOs, is the cost of maintaining a potentially quadratic number of interactions between a massive number of objects, laid out in a spatial dimension. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), this means recognizing the need for architectures to handle billions of devices and their interactions. Research into IoT was fueled by research in wireless sensor networks, but rather than start from a device perspective, this article looks at how architectures deal with interacting entities at large scale. The domain of MMOWs is examined for properties that are affected by scale. Thereafter the domain of IoT is evaluated to see if each of those properties are found and how each is handled. By comparing the current state of the art of MMOWs and IoT, with respect to scalability, it is discussed how research from one domain can possibly be exapted to the other domain and vice versa. A case study of a MMOW interfacing with IoT is presented in closing."

    title "context aware sensor search selection and ranking model for internet of things middleware"
    abstract "As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a substantial acceleration of the growth rate in the future. It is also evident that the increasing number of IoT middleware solutions are developed in both research and commercial environments. However, sensor search and selection remain a critical requirement and a challenge. In this paper, we present CASSARAM, a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model for Internet of Things to address the research challenges of selecting sensors when large numbers of sensors with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available. CASSARAM proposes the search and selection of sensors based on user priorities. CASSARAM considers a broad range of characteristics of sensors for search such as reliability, accuracy, battery life just to name a few. Our approach utilises both semantic querying and quantitative reasoning techniques. User priority based weighted Euclidean distance comparison in multidimensional space technique is used to index and rank sensors. Our objectives are to highlight the importance of sensor search in IoT paradigm, identify important characteristics of both sensors and data acquisition processes which help to select sensors, understand how semantic and statistical reasoning can be combined together to address this problem in an efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate the proposed model in terms of resource consumption and response time."

    title "energy efficient location and activity aware on demand mobile distributed sensing platform for sensing as a service in iot clouds"
    abstract "The Internet of Things (IoT)&#160;envisions billions of sensors deployed around us and connected to the Internet, where the mobile crowd sensing technologies are widely used to collect data in different contexts of the IoT paradigm. Due to the popularity of Big Data technologies, processing and storing large volumes of data have become easier than ever. However, large-scale data management tasks still require significant amounts of resources that can be expensive regardless of whether they are purchased or rented (e.g., pay-as-you-go infrastructure). Further, not everyone is interested in such large-scale data collection and analysis. More importantly, not everyone has the financial and computational resources to deal with such large volumes of data. Therefore, a timely need exists for a cloud-integrated mobile crowd sensing platform that is capable of capturing sensors data, on-demand, based on conditions enforced by the data consumers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware, specifically, location and activity-aware mobile sensing platform called context-aware mobile sensor data engine (C-MOSDEN) for the IoT domain. We evaluated the proposed platform using three real-world scenarios that highlight the importance of  selective sensing . The computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform are investigated and are used to highlight the advantages of context-aware selective sensing."

    abstract "The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of the Internet of the future and will comprise billions of intelligent communicating &#8220;things&#8221; or Internet Connected Objects (ICOs) that will have sensing, actuating, and data processing capabilities. Each ICO will have one or more embedded sensors that will capture potentially enormous amounts of data. The sensors and related data streams can be clustered physically or virtually, which raises the challenge of searching and selecting the right sensors for a query in an efficient and effective way. This paper proposes a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model, called CASSARAM, to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. CASSARAM considers user preferences and a broad range of sensor characteristics such as reliability, accuracy, location, battery life, and many more. This paper highlights the importance of sensor search, selection and ranking for the IoT, identifies important characteristics of both sensors and data capture processes, and discusses how semantic and quantitative reasoning can be combined together. This paper also addresses challenges such as efficient distributed sensor search and relational-expression based filtering. CASSARAM testing and performance evaluation results are presented and discussed."

    title "big data privacy in the internet of things era"
    abstract "Over the last few years, we've seen a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, products, and services make their way into the industry's marketplace. All such solutions will capture large amounts of data pertaining to the environment as well as their users. The IoT's objective is to learn more and better serve system users. Some IoT solutions might store data locally on devices (&#34;things&#34;), whereas others might store it in the cloud. The real value of collecting data comes through data processing and aggregation on a large scale, where new knowledge can be extracted. However, such procedures can lead to user privacy issues. This article discusses some of the main challenges of privacy in the IoT as well as opportunities for research and innovation. The authors also introduce some of the ongoing research efforts that address IoT privacy issues."

    abstract "Abstract   The next wave of communication and applications will rely on new services provided by the Internet of Things which is becoming an important aspect in human and machines future. IoT services are a key solution for providing smart environments in homes, buildings, and cities. In the era of massive number of connected things and objects with high growth rate, several challenges have been raised, such as management, aggregation, and storage for big produced data. To address some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to the IoT as Cloud of Things (CoT), which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to enhance the large-scale IoT platforms. There are several factors to be considered in the design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects. This problem can be addressed by deploying a suitable &#8220;middleware&#8221; which sits between things and applications as a reliable platform for communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and architectures. The main aim of this paper is to study the middleware technologies for CoT. Toward this end, we first present the main features and characteristics of middlewares. Next, we study different architecture styles and service domains. Then, we present several middlewares that are suitable for CoT-based platforms and finally, a list of current challenges and issues in the design of CoT-based middlewares is discussed."

    abstract "As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT."

    title "fog computing systems state of the art research issues and future trends"
    abstract "Many future innovative computing services will use Fog Computing Systems (FCS), integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) resources. These new services, built on the convergence of several distinct technologies, need to fulfil time-sensitive functions, provide variable levels of integration with their environment, and incorporate data storage, computation, communications, sensing, and control. There are, however, significant problems to be solved before such systems can be considered fit for purpose. The high heterogeneity, complexity, and dynamics of these resource-constrained systems bring new challenges to their robust and reliable operation, which implies the need for integral resilience management strategies. This paper surveys the state of the art in the relevant fields, and discusses the research issues and future trends that are emerging. We envisage future applications that have very stringent requirements, notably high-precision latency and synchronization between a large set of flows, where FCSs are key to supporting them. Thus, we hope to provide new insights into the design and management of resilient FCSs that are formed by IoT devices, edge computer servers and wireless sensor networks; these systems can be modelled using Game Theory, and flexibly programmed with the latest software and virtualization platforms."
