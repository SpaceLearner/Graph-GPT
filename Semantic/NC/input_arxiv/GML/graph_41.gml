    title "linear finite field deterministic networks with many sources and one destination"
    abstract "We find the capacity region of linear finite-field deterministic networks with many sources and one destination. Nodes in the network are subject to interference and broadcast constraints, specified by the linear finite-field deterministic model. Each node can inject its own information as well as relay other nodes' information. We show that the capacity region coincides with the cut-set region. Also, for a specific case of correlated sources we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the sources transmissibility. Given the &#34;deterministic model&#34; approximation for the corresponding Gaussian network model, our results may be relevant to wireless sensor networks where the sensing nodes multiplex the relayed data from the other nodes with their own data, and where the goal is to decode all data at a single &#34;collector&#34; node."

    title "universal source coding over generalized complementary delivery networks"
    abstract "This paper deals with a universal coding problem for a certain kind of multiterminal source coding network called a generalized complementary delivery network. In this network, messages from multiple correlated sources are jointly encoded, and each decoder has access to some of the messages to enable it to reproduce the other messages. Both fixed-to-fixed length and fixed-to-variable length lossless coding schemes are considered. Explicit constructions of universal codes and the bounds of the error probabilities are clarified by using methods of types and graph-theoretical analysis."

    title "a multiway relay channel with balanced sources"
    abstract "We consider a joint source-channel coding problem on a finite-field multiway relay channel, and we give closed-form lower and upper bounds on the optimal source-channel rate. These bounds are shown to be tight for all discrete memoryless sources in a certain class   ${\mathcal{P}^\ast}$  , and we demonstrate that strict source-channel separation is optimal within this class. We show how to test whether a given source belongs to   ${\mathcal{P}^\ast}$  , we give a balanced-information regularity condition for   ${\mathcal{P}^\ast}$  , and we express   ${\mathcal{P}^\ast}$   in terms of conditional multiple-mutual information. Finally, we show that   ${\mathcal{P}^\ast}$   is useful for a centralized storage problem."

    title "network information flow with correlated sources"
    abstract "In this paper, we consider a network communications problem in which multiple correlated sources must be delivered to a single data collector node, over a network of noisy independent point-to-point channels. We prove that perfect reconstruction of all the sources at the sink is possible if and only if, for all partitions of the network nodes into two subsets S and S^c such that the sink is always in S^c, we have that H(U_S|U_{S^c}) < \sum_{i\in S,j\in S^c} C_{ij}. Our main finding is that in this setup a general source/channel separation theorem holds, and that Shannon information behaves as a classical network flow, identical in nature to the flow of water in pipes. At first glance, it might seem surprising that separation holds in a fairly general network situation like the one we study. A closer look, however, reveals that the reason for this is that our model allows only for independent point-to-point channels between pairs of nodes, and not multiple-access and/or broadcast channels, for which separation is well known not to hold. This ``information as flow'' view provides an algorithmic interpretation for our results, among which perhaps the most important one is the optimality of implementing codes using a layered protocol stack."

    abstract "We consider the problem of transmission of several discrete sources over a multiple access channel (MAC) with side information at the sources and the decoder. Source-channel separation does not hold for this channel. Sufficient conditions are provided for transmission of sources with a given distortion. The channel could have continuous alphabets (Gaussian MAC is a special case). Various previous results are obtained as special cases."

    title "polymatroids with network coding"
    abstract "The problem of network coding for multicasting a single source to multiple sinks has first been studied by Ahlswede, Cai, Li and Yeung in 2000, in which they have established the celebrated max-flow mini-cut theorem on non-physical information flow over a network of independent channels. On the other hand, in 1980, Han has studied the case with correlated multiple sources and a single sink from the viewpoint of polymatroidal functions in which a necessary and sufficient condition has been demonstrated for reliable transmission over the network. This paper presents an attempt to unify both cases, which leads to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for reliable transmission over a noisy network for multicasting all the correlated multiple sources to all the multiple sinks. Furthermore, we address also the problem of transmitting &#34;independent&#34; sources over a multiple-access-type of network as well as over a broadcast-type of network, which reveals that the (co-) polymatroidal structures are intrinsically involved in these types of network coding."

    title "beyond the cut set bound uncertainty computations in network coding with correlated sources"
    abstract "Cut-set bounds are not, in general, tight for all classes of network communication problems. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for proving converses for the problem of transmission of correlated sources in networks, which results in bounds that are tighter than the corresponding cut-set bounds. We also define the concept of &#8220;uncertainty region&#8221; which might be of independent interest. We provide a full characterization of this region for the case of two correlated random variables. The bounding technique works as follows: on one hand, we show that if the communication problem is solvable, the uncertainty of certain random variables in the network with respect to imaginary parties that have partial knowledge of the sources must satisfy some constraints that depend on the network architecture. On the other hand, the same uncertainties have to satisfy constraints that only depend on the joint distribution of the sources. Matching these two leads to restrictions on the statistical joint distribution of the sources in communication problems that are solvable over a given network architecture. Our technique also provides nontrivial outer bounds for communication problems with secrecy constraints."

    title "models statistics and rates of binary correlated sources"
    abstract "This paper discusses and analyzes various models of binary correlated sources, which may be relevant in several distributed communication scenarios. These models are statistically characterized in terms of joint Probability Mass Function (PMF) and covariance. Closed-form expressions for the joint entropy of the sources are also presented. The asymptotic entropy rate for very large number of sources is shown to converge to a common limit for all the considered models. This fact generalizes recent results on the information-theoretic performance limit of communication schemes which exploit the correlation among sources at the receiver."

    title "cut set bounds on network information flow"
    abstract "Explicit characterization of the capacity region of communication networks is a long-standing problem. While it is known that network coding can outperform routing and replication, the set of feasible rates is not known in general. Characterizing the network coding capacity region requires the determination of the set of all entropic vectors. Furthermore, computing the explicitly known linear programming bound is infeasible in practice due to an exponential growth in complexity as a function of network size. This paper focuses on the fundamental problems of characterization and computation of outer bounds for multi-source multi-sink networks. Starting from the known local functional dependence induced by the communication network, we introduce the notion of irreducible sets, which characterize implied functional dependence. We provide recursions for the computation of all maximal irreducible sets. These sets act as information-theoretic bottlenecks, and provide an easily computable outer bound for networks with correlated sources. We extend the notion of irreducible sets (and resulting outer bound) for networks with independent sources. We compare our bounds with existing bounds in the literature. We find that our new bounds are the best among the known graph theoretic bounds for networks with correlated sources and for networks with independent sources."

    title "quantized network coding for sparse messages"
    abstract "In this paper, we study the data gathering problem in the context of power grids by using a network of sensors, where the sensed data have inter-node redundancy. Specifically, we propose a new transmission method, called quantized network coding, which performs linear network coding in the infinite field of real numbers, and quantization to accommodate the finite capacity of edges. By using the concepts in compressed sensing literature, we propose to use l 1 -minimization to decode the quantized network coded packets, especially when the number of received packets at the decoder is less than the size of sensed data (i.e. number of nodes). We also propose an appropriate design for network coding coefficients, based on restricted isometry property, which results in robust l 1 -min decoding. Our numerical analysis show that the proposed quantized network coding scheme with l 1 -min decoding can achieve significant improvements, in terms of compression ratio and delivery delay, compared to conventional packet forwarding."

    title "on the scalability of cooperative time synchronization in pulse connected networks"
    abstract "We consider the problem of time synchronization in dense wireless networks. Well established synchronization techniques suffer from an inherent scalability problem, in that synchronization errors grow unbound with increasing network density. In this work, first we develop a model for communication in wireless networks, and then we use the model to define a new time synchronization mechanism. A salient feature of the proposed method is that, in the regime of asymptotically dense networks, it achieves global synchronization with errors bounded by constants independent of network size; and furthermore, this error is the smallest possible achievable by any pair of nodes anywhere in the network, irrespective of the distance separating them. Another contribution is that our model and proofs are purely probabilistic, in contrast to formulations in terms of dynamical systems that are standard in the literature on time synchronization problems."

    abstract "We consider the capacity problem for wireless networks. Networks are modeled as random unit-disk graphs, and the capacity problem is formulated as one of finding the maximum value of a multicommodity flow. In this paper, we develop a proof technique based on which we are able to obtain a tight characterization of the solution to the linear program associated with the multiflow problem, to within constants independent of network size. We also use this proof method to analyze network capacity for a variety of transmitter/receiver architectures, for which we obtain some conclusive results. These results contain as a special case (and strengthen) those of Gupta and Kumar for random networks, for which a new derivation is provided using only elementary counting and discrete probability tools."

The characterisation is obtained using a joint source-channel random-coding argument, which is based on a combination of Wyner et al.'s Cascaded Slepian-Wolf Source Coding and Tuncel's Slepian-Wolf Coding over Broadcast Channels. We prove a separation theorem for the special case of two nodes; that is, we show that a modular code architecture with separate source and channel coding functions is (asymptotically) optimal. Finally, we propose a practical coding scheme based on low-density parity-check codes, and we analyse its performance using multi-edge density evolution."

Besides providing the syntax and semantics for the calculus, we show its expressiveness by providing implementations for several examples of typical operations on sensor networks. Also included is a detailed discussion of possible extensions to CSN that enable the modeling of other important features of these networks such as sensor state, sampling strategies, and network security."

In the context of communication networks, navigable small-world topologies, i.e. those which admit efficient distributed routing algorithms, are deemed particularly effective, for example in resource discovery tasks and peer-to-peer applications. Intrigued by the fundamental limits of communication in networks that exploit this type of topology, we study two classes of navigable small-world networks from the point of view of network information flow and provide inner and outer bounds for their max-flow min-cut capacity. Our contribution is in contrast with the standard approach to small world networks which privileges parameters pertaining to connectivity."

    title "source and physical layer network coding for correlated two way relaying"
    abstract "In this paper, the authors study a half-duplex two-way relay channel with correlated sources exchanging bidirectional information. In the case, when both sources have the knowledge of correlation statistics, a source compression with physical-layer network coding scheme is proposed to perform the distributed compression at each source node. When only the relay has the knowledge of correlation statistics, the authors propose a relay compression with physical-layer network coding scheme to compress the bidirectional messages at the relay. The closed-form block error rate expressions of both schemes are derived and verified through simulations. It is shown that the proposed schemes achieve considerable improvements in both error performance and throughput compared with the conventional non-compression scheme in correlated two-way relay networks."
