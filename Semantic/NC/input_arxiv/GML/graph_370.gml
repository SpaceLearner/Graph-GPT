    title "weighted naive bayes model for semi structured document categorization"
    abstract "The aim of this paper is the supervised classification of semi-structured data. A formal model based on bayesian classification is developed while addressing the integration of the document structure into classification tasks. We define what we call the structural context of occurrence for unstructured data, and we derive a recursive formulation in which parameters are used to weight the contribution of structural element relatively to the others. A simplified version of this formal model is implemented to carry out textual documents classification experiments. First results show, for a adhoc weighting strategy, that the structural context of word occurrences has a significant impact on classification results comparing to the performance of a simple multinomial naive Bayes classifier. The proposed implementation competes on the Reuters-21578 data with the SVM classifier associated or not with the splitting of structural components. These results encourage exploring the learning of acceptable weighting strategies for this model, in particular boosting strategies."

    title "on detecting messaging abuse in short text messages using linguistic and behavioral patterns"
    abstract "The use of short text messages in social media and instant messaging has become a popular communication channel during the last years. This rising popularity has caused an increment in messaging threats such as spam, phishing or malware as well as other threats. The processing of these short text message threats could pose additional challenges such as the presence of lexical variants, SMS-like contractions or advanced obfuscations which can degrade the performance of traditional filtering solutions. By using a real-world SMS data set from a large telecommunications operator from the US and a social media corpus, in this paper we analyze the effectiveness of machine learning filters based on linguistic and behavioral patterns in order to detect short text spam and abusive users in the network. We have also explored different ways to deal with short text message challenges such as tokenization and entity detection by using text normalization and substring clustering techniques. The obtained results show the validity of the proposed solution by enhancing baseline approaches."

    title "from frequency to meaning vector space models of semantics"
    abstract "Computers understand very little of the meaning of human language. This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field."

    title "applying machine learning to the problem of choosing a heuristic to select the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition"
    abstract "Cylindrical algebraic decomposition(CAD) is a key tool in computational algebraic geometry, particularly for quantifier elimination over real-closed fields. When using CAD, there is often a choice for the ordering placed on the variables. This can be important, with some problems infeasible with one variable ordering but easy with another. Machine learning is the process of fitting a computer model to a complex function based on properties learned from measured data. In this paper we use machine learning (specifically a support vector machine) to select between heuristics for choosing a variable ordering, outperforming each of the separate heuristics."

    title "which clustering do you want inducing your ideal clustering with minimal feedback"
    abstract "While traditional research on text clustering has largely focused on grouping documents by topic, it is conceivable that a user may want to cluster documents along other dimensions, such as the author's mood, gender, age, or sentiment. Without knowing the user's intention, a clustering algorithm will only group documents along the most prominent dimension, which may not be the one the user desires. To address the problem of clustering documents along the user-desired dimension, previous work has focused on learning a similarity metric from data manually annotated with the user's intention or having a human construct a feature space in an interactive manner during the clustering process. With the goal of reducing reliance on human knowledge for fine-tuning the similarity function or selecting the relevant features required by these approaches, we propose a novel active clustering algorithm, which allows a user to easily select the dimension along which she wants to cluster the documents by inspecting only a small number of words. We demonstrate the viability of our algorithm on a variety of commonly-used sentiment datasets."

    title "solutions to detect and analyze online radicalization a survey"
    abstract "Online Radicalization (also called Cyber-Terrorism or Extremism or Cyber-Racism or Cyber- Hate) is widespread and has become a major and growing concern to the society, governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Research shows that various platforms on the Internet (low barrier to publish content, allows anonymity, provides exposure to millions of users and a potential of a very quick and widespread diffusion of message) such as YouTube (a popular video sharing website), Twitter (an online micro-blogging service), Facebook (a popular social networking website), online discussion forums and blogosphere are being misused for malicious intent. Such platforms are being used to form hate groups, racist communities, spread extremist agenda, incite anger or violence, promote radicalization, recruit members and create virtual organi- zations and communities. Automatic detection of online radicalization is a technically challenging problem because of the vast amount of the data, unstructured and noisy user-generated content, dynamically changing content and adversary behavior. There are several solutions proposed in the literature aiming to combat and counter cyber-hate and cyber-extremism. In this survey, we review solutions to detect and analyze online radicalization. We review 40 papers published at 12 venues from June 2003 to November 2011. We present a novel classification scheme to classify these papers. We analyze these techniques, perform trend analysis, discuss limitations of existing techniques and find out research gaps."

    title "inference and evaluation of the multinomial mixture model for text clustering"
    abstract "In this article, we investigate the use of a probabilistic model for unsupervised clustering in text collections. Unsupervised clustering has become a basic module for many intelligent text processing applications, such as information retrieval, text classification or information extraction. Recent proposals have been made of probabilistic clustering models, which build ''soft'' theme-document associations. These models allow to compute, for each document, a probability vector whose values can be interpreted as the strength of the association between documents and clusters. As such, these vectors can also serve to project texts into a lower-dimensional ''semantic'' space. These models however pose non-trivial estimation problems, which are aggravated by the very high dimensionality of the parameter space. The model considered in this paper consists of a mixture of multinomial distributions over the word counts, each component corresponding to a different theme. We propose a systematic evaluation framework to contrast various estimation procedures for this model. Starting with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm as the basic tool for inference, we discuss the importance of initialization and the influence of other features, such as the smoothing strategy or the size of the vocabulary, thereby illustrating the difficulties incurred by the high dimensionality of the parameter space. We empirically show that, in the case of text processing, these difficulties can be alleviated by introducing the vocabulary incrementally, due to the specific profile of the word count distributions. Using the fact that the model parameters can be analytically integrated out, we finally show that Gibbs sampling on the theme configurations is tractable and compares favorably to the basic EM approach."

    title "modeling creativity case studies in python"
    abstract "Modeling Creativity (doctoral dissertation, 2013) explores how creativity can be represented using computational approaches. Our aim is to construct computer models that exhibit creativity in an artistic context, that is, that are capable of generating or evaluating an artwork (visual or linguistic), an interesting new idea, a subjective opinion. The research was conducted in 2008-2012 at the Computational Linguistics Research Group (CLiPS, University of Antwerp) under the supervision of Prof. Walter Daelemans. Prior research was also conducted at the Experimental Media Research Group (EMRG, St. Lucas University College of Art &#38; Design Antwerp) under the supervision of Lucas Nijs. #R##N#Modeling Creativity examines creativity in a number of different perspectives: from its origins in nature, which is essentially blind, to humans and machines, and from generating creative ideas to evaluating and learning their novelty and usefulness. We will use a hands-on approach with case studies and examples in the Python programming language."

    title "machine learning in automated text categorization"
    abstract "The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation."

    title "text classification a sequential reading approach"
    abstract "We propose to model the text classification process as a sequential decision process. In this process, an agent learns to classify documents into topics while reading the document sentences sequentially and learns to stop as soon as enough information was read for deciding. The proposed algorithm is based on a modelisation of Text Classification as a Markov Decision Process and learns by using Reinforcement Learning. Experiments on four different classical mono-label corpora show that the proposed approach performs comparably to classical SVM approaches for large training sets, and better for small training sets. In addition, the model automatically adapts its reading process to the quantity of training information provided."

    title "autonomy and reliability of continuous active learning for technology assisted review"
    abstract "We enhance the autonomy of the continuous active learning method shown by Cormack and Grossman (SIGIR 2014) to be effective for technology-assisted review, in which documents from a collection are retrieved and reviewed, using relevance feedback, until substantially all of the relevant documents have been reviewed. Autonomy is enhanced through the elimination of topic-specific and dataset-specific tuning parameters, so that the sole input required by the user is, at the outset, a short query, topic description, or single relevant document; and, throughout the review, ongoing relevance assessments of the retrieved documents. We show that our enhancements consistently yield superior results to Cormack and Grossman's version of continuous active learning, and other methods, not only on average, but on the vast majority of topics from four separate sets of tasks: the legal datasets examined by Cormack and Grossman, the Reuters RCV1-v2 subject categories, the TREC 6 AdHoc task, and the construction of the TREC 2002 filtering test collection."

    title "using network science and text analytics to produce surveys in a scientific topic"
    abstract "The use of science to understand its own structure is becoming popular, but understanding the organization of knowledge areas is still limited because some patterns are only discoverable with proper computational treatment of large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a framework to combine network-based methodologies and text analytics to construct the taxonomy of science fields. The methodology is illustrated with application to two topics: complex networks (CN) and photonic crystals (PC). We built citation networks using data from the Web of Science and used a community detection algorithm for partitioning to obtain science maps for the two topics. We also created an importance index for text analytics, which is employed to extract keywords that define the communities and, combined with network topology metrics, to generate dendrograms of relatedness among subtopics. Interesting patterns emerging from the analysis included identification of two well-defined communities in PC area, which is consistent with the known existence of two distinct communities of researchers in the area: telecommunication engineers and physicists. With the methodology, it was also possible to assess the interdisciplinary nature and time evolution of subtopics defined by the keywords. The automatic tools described here are potentially useful not only to provide an overview of scientific areas but also to assist scientists in performing systematic research on a specific topic."

    title "online model evaluation in a large scale computational advertising platform"
    abstract "Online media provides opportunities for marketers through which they can deliver effective brand messages to a wide range of audiences at scale. Advertising technology platforms enable advertisers to reach their target audience by delivering ad impressions to online users in real time. In order to identify the best marketing message for a user and to purchase impressions at the right price, we rely heavily on bid prediction and optimization models. Even though the bid prediction models are well studied in the literature, the equally important subject of model evaluation is usually overlooked or not discussed in detail. Effective and reliable evaluation of an online bidding model is crucial for making faster model improvements as well as for utilizing the marketing budgets more efficiently. In this paper, we present an experimentation framework for bid prediction models where our focus is on the practical aspects of model evaluation. Specifically, we outline the unique challenges we encounter in our platform due to a variety of factors such as heterogeneous goal definitions, varying budget requirements across different campaigns, high seasonality and the auction-based environment for inventory purchasing. Then, we introduce return on investment (ROI) as a unified model performance (i.e., success) metric and explain its merits over more traditional metrics such as click-through rate (CTR) or conversion rate (CVR). Most importantly, we discuss commonly used evaluation and metric summarization approaches in detail and propose a more accurate method for online evaluation of new experimental models against the baseline. Our meta-analysis-based approach addresses various shortcomings of other methods and yields statistically robust conclusions that allow us to conclude experiments more quickly in a reliable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation strategy on real campaign data through some experiments."

    title "utility theoretic ranking for semiautomated text classification"
    abstract "Semiautomated Text Classification (SATC) may be defined as the task of ranking a set D of automatically labelled textual documents in such a way that, if a human annotator validates (i.e., inspects and corrects where appropriate) the documents in a top-ranked portion of D with the goal of increasing the overall labelling accuracy of D, the expected increase is maximized. An obvious SATC strategy is to rank D so that the documents that the classifier has labelled with the lowest confidence are top ranked. In this work, we show that this strategy is suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the notion of validation gain, defined as the improvement in classification effectiveness that would derive by validating a given automatically labelled document. We also propose a new effectiveness measure for SATC-oriented ranking methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about by partially validating a list generated by a given ranking method. We report the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method mentioned earlier, and according to the proposed measure, our utility-theoretic ranking methods can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification error."

This setting occurs in many problems such as the classification of pieces of mail containing several pages, of web sites with several sections or of images that have been pre-segmented into smaller regions. We propose generalizations of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that are appropriate in this context and explore how to incorporate different assumptions about the relationship between the input sets and the target class within the RBM. In experiments on standard multiple-instance learning datasets, we demonstrate the competitiveness of approaches based on RBMs and apply the proposed variants to the problem of incoming mail classification."

    abstract "We propose and study a novel supervised approach to learning statistical semantic relatedness models from subjectively annotated training examples. The proposed semantic model consists of parameterized co-occurrence statistics associated with textual units of a large background knowledge corpus. We present an efficient algorithm for learning such semantic models from a training sample of relatedness preferences. Our method is corpus independent and can essentially rely on any sufficiently large (unstructured) collection of coherent texts. Moreover, the approach facilitates the fitting of semantic models for specific users or groups of users. We present the results of extensive range of experiments from small to large scale, indicating that the proposed method is effective and competitive with the state-of-the-art."
