    title "in pursuit of spreadsheet excellence"
    abstract "The first fully-documented study into the quantitative impact of errors in operational spreadsheets identified an interesting anomaly. One of the five participating organisations involved in the study contributed a set of five spreadsheets of such quality that they set the organisation apart in a statistical sense. This virtuoso performance gave rise to a simple sampling test - The Clean Sheet Test - which can be used to objectively evaluate if an organisation is in control of the spreadsheets it is using in important processes such as financial reporting."

    title "spreadsheet end user behaviour analysis"
    abstract "To aid the development of spreadsheet debugging tools, a knowledge of end-users natural behaviour within the Excel environment would be advantageous. This paper details the design and application of a novel data acquisition tool, which can be used for the unobtrusive recording of end-users mouse, keyboard and Excel specific actions during the debugging of Excel spreadsheets. A debugging experiment was conducted using this data acquisition tool, and based on analysis of end-users performance and behaviour data, the authors developed a &#34;spreadsheet cell coverage feedback&#34; debugging tool. Results from the debugging experiment are presented in terms of enduser debugging performance and behaviour, and the outcomes of an evaluation experiment with the debugging tool are detailed."

    title "controlling end user computing applications a case study"
    abstract "We report the results of a project to control the use of end user computing tools for business critical applications in a banking environment. Several workstreams were employed in order to bring about a cultural change within the bank towards the use of spreadsheets and other end-user tools, covering policy development, awareness and skills training, inventory monitoring, user licensing, key risk metrics and mitigation approaches. The outcomes of these activities are discussed, and conclusions are drawn as to the need for appropriate organisational models to guide the use of these tools."

    abstract "Excel lacks features for modular design. Had it such features, as do most programming languages, they would save time, avoid unneeded programming, make mistakes less likely, make code-control easier, help organisations adopt a uniform house style, and open business opportunities in buying and selling spreadsheet modules. I present Excelsior, a system for bringing these benefits to Excel."

    title "regulation and the integrity of spreadsheets in the information supply chain"
    abstract "Spreadsheets provide many of the key links between information systems, closing the gap between business needs and the capability of central systems. Recent regulations have brought these vulnerable parts of information supply chains into focus. The risk they present to the organisation depends on the role that they fulfil, with generic differences between their use as modeling tools and as operational applications. Four sections of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) are particularly relevant to the use of spreadsheets. Compliance with each of these sections is dependent on maintaining the integrity of those spreadsheets acting as operational applications. This can be achieved manually but at high cost. There are a range of commercially available off-the-shelf solutions that can reduce this cost. These may be divided into those that assist in the debugging of logic and more recently the arrival of solutions that monitor the change and user activity taking place in business-critical spreadsheets. ClusterSeven provides one of these monitoring solutions, highlighting areas of operational risk whilst also establishing a database of information to deliver new business intelligence."

    title "new guidelines for spreadsheets"
    abstract "Current prescriptions for spreadsheet style specify modular separation of data, calcu1ation and output, based on the notion that writing a spreadsheet is like writing a computer program. Instead of a computer programming style, this article examines rules of style for text, graphics, and mathematics. Much 'common wisdom' in spreadsheets contradicts rules for these well-developed arts. A case is made here for a new style for spreadsheets that emphasises readability. The new style is described in detail with an example, and contrasted with the programming style."

    title "an empirical study of end user behaviour in spreadsheet error detection correction"
    abstract "Very little is known about the process by which end-user developers detect and correct spreadsheet errors. Any research pertaining to the development of spreadsheet testing methodologies or auditing tools would benefit from information on how end-users perform the debugging process in practice. Thirteen industry-based professionals and thirty-four accounting &#38; finance students took part in a current ongoing experiment designed to record and analyse end-user behaviour in spreadsheet error detection and correction. Professionals significantly outperformed students in correcting certain error types. Time-based cell activity analysis showed that a strong correlation exists between the percentage of cells inspected and the number of errors corrected. The cell activity data was gathered through a purpose written VBA Excel plug-in that records the time and detail of all cell selection and cell change actions of individuals."

    abstract "A new MS Excel application has been developed which seeks to reduce the risks associated with the development, operation and auditing of Excel spreadsheets. FormulaDataSleuth provides a means of checking spreadsheet formulas and data as they are developed or used, enabling the users to identify actual or potential errors quickly and thereby halt their propagation. In this paper, we will describe, with examples, how the application works and how it can be applied to reduce the risks associated with Excel spreadsheets."

    abstract "Spreadsheets have been with us in their present form for over a quarter of a century. We have become so used to them that we forget that we are using them at all. It may serve us well to stand back for a moment to review where, when and how we use spreadsheets in the financial markets and elsewhere in order to inform research that may guide their future development. In this article I bring together the experiences of a number of senior practitioners who have spent much of their careers working with large spreadsheets that have been and continue to be used to support major financial transactions and manage large institutions in the City of London. The author suggests that the City of London is presently exposed to significant reputational risk through the continued uncontrolled use of critical spreadsheets in the financial markets and elsewhere."

    abstract "We developed an internet-based questionnaire on spreadsheet use that we administered to a large number of users in several companies and organizations to document how spreadsheets are currently being developed and used in business. In this paper, we discuss the results drawn from of a comparison of responses from individuals with the most experience and expertise with those from individuals with the least. These results describe two views of spreadsheet design and use in organizations, and reflect gaps between these two groups and between these groups and the entire population of nearly 1600 respondents. Moreover, our results indicate that these gaps have multiple dimensions: they reflect not only the context, skill, and practices of individual users but also the policies of large organizations."

    title "automating spreadsheet discovery risk assessment"
    abstract "There have been many articles and mishaps published about the risks of uncontrolled spreadsheets in today's business environment, including non-compliance, operational risk, errors, and fraud all leading to significant loss events. Spreadsheets fall into the realm of end user developed applications and are often absent the proper safeguards and controls an IT organization would enforce for enterprise applications. There is also an overall lack of software programming discipline enforced in how spreadsheets are developed. However, before an organization can apply proper controls and discipline to critical spreadsheets, an accurate and living inventory of spreadsheets across the enterprise must be created, and all critical spreadsheets must be identified. As such, this paper proposes an automated approach to the initial stages of the spreadsheet management lifecycle - discovery, inventory and risk assessment. Without the use of technology, these phases are often treated as a one-off project. By leveraging technology, they become a sustainable business process."

    title "user defined spreadsheet functions in excel"
    abstract "Creating user defined functions (UDFs) is a powerful method to improve the quality of computer applications, in particular spreadsheets. However, the only direct way to use UDFs in spreadsheets is to switch from the functional and declarative style of spreadsheet formulas to the imperative VBA, which creates a high entry barrier even for proficient spreadsheet users. It has been proposed to extend Excel by UDFs declared by a spreadsheet: user defined spreadsheet functions (UDSFs). In this paper we present a method to create a limited form of UDSFs in Excel without any use of VBA. Calls to those UDSFs utilize what-if data tables to execute the same part of a worksheet several times, thus turning it into a reusable function definition."

The algorithm uses a weighted average of the Shannon Entropies of the string and all but the last binary derivative of the string. We successfully test the algorithm in the fields of Prime Number Theory (where we prove explicitly that the sequence of prime numbers is not periodic), Human Vision, Cryptography, Random Number Generation and Quantitative Finance."

    abstract "There is overwhelming evidence that the continued and widespread use of untested spreadsheets in business gives rise to regular, significant and unexpected financial losses. Whilst this is worrying, it is perhaps a relatively minor concern compared with the risks arising from the use of poorly constructed and/or untested spreadsheets in medicine, a practice that is already occurring. This article is intended as a warning that the use of poorly constructed and/or untested spreadsheets in clinical medicine cannot be tolerated. It supports this warning by reporting on potentially serious weaknesses found while testing a limited number of publicly available clinical spreadsheets."

    title "effect of range naming conventions on reliability and development time for simple spreadsheet formulas"
    abstract "Practitioners often argue that range names make spreadsheets easier to understand and use, akin to the role of good variable names in traditional programming languages, yet there is no supporting scientific evidence. The authors previously published experiments that disproved this theory in relation to debugging, and now turn their focus to development. This paper presents the results of two iterations of a new experiment, which measure the effect of range names on the correctness of, and the time it takes to develop, simple summation formulas. Our findings, supported by statistically significant results, show that formulas developed by non-experts using range names are more likely to contain errors and take longer to develop. Taking these findings with the findings from previous experiments, we conclude that range names do not improve the quality of spreadsheets developed by novice and intermediate users. This paper is important in that it finds that the choice of naming convention can have a significant impact on novice and intermediate users' performance in formula development, with less structured naming conventions resulting in poorer performance by users."

    title "spreadsheet components for all"
    abstract "We have prototyped a &#34;spreadsheet component repository&#34; Web site, from which users can copy &#34;components&#34; into their own Excel or Google spreadsheets. Components are collections of cells containing formulae: in real life, they would do useful calculations that many practitioners find hard to program, and would be rigorously tested and documented. Crucially, the user can tell the repository which cells in their spreadsheet to use for a componen's inputs and outputs. The repository will then reshape the component to fit. A single component can therefore be used in many different sizes and shapes of spreadsheet. We hope to set up a spreadsheet equivalent of the high-quality numerical subroutine libraries that revolutionised scientific computing, but where instead of subroutines, the library contains such components."

    title "the lookup technique to replace nested if formulas in spreadsheet programming"
    abstract "Spreadsheet programmers often implement contingent logic using a nested-IF formula even though this technique is difficult to test and audit and is believed to be risky. We interpret the programming of contingent logic in spreadsheets in the context of traditional computer programming. We investigate the &#34;lookup technique&#34; as an alternative to nested-IF formulas, describe its benefits for testing and auditing, and define its limitations. The lookup technique employs four distinct principles: 1) make logical tests visible; 2) make outcomes visible; 3) make logical structure visible; and 4) replace a multi-function nested-IF formula with a single-function lookup formula. It can be used only for certain simple contingent logic. We describe how the principles can be applied in more complex situations, and suggest avenues for further research."

    abstract "This paper offers a brief review of cognitive verbs typically used in the literature to describe standard spreadsheet practices. The verbs identified are then categorised in terms of Bloom's Taxonomy of Hierarchical Levels, and then rated and arranged to distinguish some of their qualities and characteristics. Some measurement items are then evaluated to see how well computerised test question items validate or reinforce training or certification. The paper considers how establishing standard practices in spreadsheet training and certification can help reduce some of the risks associated with spreadsheets, and help promote productivity."
