      <data key="title">energy efficient and fair resource allocation for lte unlicensed uplink networks a two sided matching approach with partial information</data>
      <data key="abstract">LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) has recently attracted worldwide interest to meet the explosion in cellular traffic data. By using carrier aggregation (CA), licensed and unlicensed bands are integrated to enhance transmission capacity while maintaining reliable and predictable performance. As there may exist other conventional unlicensed band users, such as Wi-Fi users, LTE-U users have to share the same unlicensed bands with them. Thus, an optimized resource allocation scheme to ensure the fairness between LTE-U users and conventional unlicensed band users is critical for the deployment of LTE-U networks. In this paper, we investigate an energy efficient resource allocation problem in LTE-U coexisting with other wireless networks, which aims at guaranteeing fairness among the users of different radio access networks (RANs). We formulate the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and propose a semi-distributed matching framework with a partial information-based algorithm to solve it. We demonstrate our contributions with simulations in which various network densities and traffic load levels are considered.</data>

      <data key="title">realization of cdma based iot services with shared band operation of lte in 5g</data>
      <data key="abstract">5G network is envisioned to deploy a massive Internet-of-Things (IoTs) with requirements of low-latency, low control overhead and low power. Current 4G network is optimized for large bandwidth applications and inefficient to handle short sporadic IoT messages. The challenge here spans multiple layer including the radio access and the network layer. This paper focus on reusing CDMA access for IoT devices considering event-driven and latency sensitive traffic profile. We propose a PHY/MAC layer design for CDMA based communication for low power IoT devices. We propose and evaluate coexisting operation of CDMA based IoT network in presence of the exiting LTE network. Our proposed design will integrate IoT traffic with legacy system by minimal modification at the edge network, essentially eNodeB. We show that the underlay CDMA IoT network meets IoT data traffic requirements with minimal degradation (3%) in the LTE throughput. We also implement the proposed design using Software Defined Radios and show the viability of the proposal under different network scenarios.</data>

      <data key="title">modeling and analyzing the coexistence of wi fi and lte in unlicensed spectrum</data>
      <data key="abstract">We leverage stochastic geometry to characterize key performance metrics for neighboring Wi-Fi and LTE networks in unlicensed spectrum. Our analysis focuses on a single unlicensed frequency band, where the locations for the Wi-Fi access points and LTE eNodeBs are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. Three LTE coexistence mechanisms are investigated: 1) LTE with continuous transmission and no protocol modifications; 2) LTE with discontinuous transmission; and 3) LTE with listen-before-talk and random back-off. For each scenario, we derive the medium access probability, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio coverage probability, the density of successful transmissions (DST), and the rate coverage probability for both Wi-Fi and LTE. Compared with the baseline scenario where one Wi-Fi network coexists with an additional Wi-Fi network, our results show that Wi-Fi performance is severely degraded when LTE transmits continuously. However, LTE is able to improve the DST and rate coverage probability of Wi-Fi while maintaining acceptable data rate performance when it adopts one or more of the following coexistence features: a shorter transmission duty cycle, lower channel access priority, or more sensitive clear channel assessment thresholds.</data>

      <data key="title">ofdmfi enabling cross technology communication between lte u laa and wifi</data>
      <data key="abstract">Despite exhibiting very high theoretical data rates, in practice, the performance of LTE-U/LAA and WiFi networks is severely limited under cross-technology coexistence scenarios in the unlicensed 5GHz band. As a remedy, recent research shows the need for collaboration and coordination among co-located networks. However, enabling such collaboration requires an information exchange that is hard to realize due to completely incompatible network protocol stacks. We propose OfdmFi, the first cross-technology communication scheme that enables direct bidirectional over-the-air communication between LTE-U/LAA and WiFi with minimal overhead to their legacy transmissions. Requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies, OfdmFi leverages the standard-compliant possibility of generating message-bearing power patterns, similar to punched cards from the early days of computers, in the time-frequency resource grid of an OFDM transmitter which can be cross-observed and decoded by a heterogeneous OFDM receiver. As a proof-of-concept, we have designed and implemented a prototype using commodity devices and SDR platforms. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that OfdmFi achieves robust bidirectional CTC between both systems with a data rate of up to 84kbps, which is more than 125x faster than state-of-the-art.</data>

      <data key="title">survey of spectrum sharing for inter technology coexistence</data>
      <data key="abstract">Increasing capacity demands in emerging wireless technologies are expected to be met by network densification and spectrum bands open to multiple technologies. These will, in turn, increase the level of interference and also result in more complex inter-technology interactions, which will need to be managed through spectrum sharing mechanisms. Consequently, novel spectrum sharing mechanisms should be designed to allow spectrum access for multiple technologies, while efficiently utilizing the spectrum resources overall. Importantly, it is not trivial to design efficient spectrum sharing mechanisms, not only due to technical aspects, but also due to regulatory and business model constraints. In this survey we address spectrum sharing mechanisms for wireless inter-technology coexistence by means of a technology circle that incorporates in a unified, system-level view the technical and non-technical aspects. We thus systematically explore the spectrum sharing design space consisting of parameters at different layers. Using this framework, we present a literature review on inter-technology coexistence with a focus on wireless technologies with the same spectrum access rights, i.e. (i) primary/primary, (ii) secondary/secondary, and (iii) technologies operating in a spectrum commons. Moreover, we reflect on our literature review to identify possible spectrum sharing design solutions and performance evaluation approaches useful for future coexistence cases. Finally, we discuss spectrum sharing design challenges and suggest potential future research directions.</data>

      <data key="title">effective capacity of licensed assisted access in unlicensed spectrum for 5g from theory to application</data>
      <data key="abstract">License-assisted access (LAA) is a promising technology to offload dramatically increasing cellular traffic to unlicensed bands. Challenges arise from the provision of quality-of-service (QoS) and the quantification of capacity, due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of LAA and legacy systems (such as WiFi) coexisting in the bands. In this paper, we develop new theories of the effective capacity to measure LAA under statistical QoS requirements. A new four-state semi-Markovian model is developed to capture transmission collisions, random backoffs, and lossy wireless channels of LAA in distributed heterogeneous network environments. A closed-form expression for the effective capacity is derived to comprehensively analyze LAA. The four-state model is further abstracted to an insightful two-state equivalent which reveals the concavity of the effective capacity in terms of transmit rate. Validated by simulations, the concavity is exploited to maximize the effective capacity and effective energy efficiency of LAA, and provide significant improvements of 62.7% and 171.4%, respectively, over existing approaches. Our results are of practical value to holistic designs and deployments of LAA systems.</data>

      <data key="abstract">With years of tremendous traffic and energy consumption growth, green radio has been valued not only for theoretical research interests but also for the operational expenditure reduction and the sustainable development of wireless communications. Fundamental green tradeoffs, served as an important framework for analysis, include four basic relationships: 1) spectrum efficiency versus energy efficiency; 2) deployment efficiency versus energy efficiency; 3) delay versus power; and 4) bandwidth versus power. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview on the extensive on-going research efforts and categorize them based on the fundamental green tradeoffs. We will then focus on research progresses of 4G and 5G communications, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and non-orthogonal aggregation, multiple input multiple output, and heterogeneous networks. We will also discuss potential challenges and impacts of fundamental green tradeoffs, to shed some light on the energy efficient research and design for future wireless networks.</data>

      <data key="title">millimeter wave beamforming for wireless backhaul and access in small cell networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recently, there has been considerable interest in new tiered network cellular architectures, which would likely use many more cell sites than found today. Two major challenges will be i) providing backhaul to all of these cells and ii) finding efficient techniques to leverage higher frequency bands for mobile access and backhaul. This paper proposes the use of outdoor millimeter wave communications for backhaul networking between cells and mobile access within a cell. To overcome the outdoor impairments found in millimeter wave propagation, this paper studies beamforming using large arrays. However, such systems will require narrow beams, increasing sensitivity to movement caused by pole sway and other environmental concerns. To overcome this, we propose an efficient beam alignment technique using adaptive subspace sampling and hierarchical beam codebooks. A wind sway analysis is presented to establish a notion of beam coherence time. This highlights a previously unexplored tradeoff between array size and wind-induced movement. Generally, it is not possible to use larger arrays without risking a corresponding performance loss from wind-induced beam misalignment. The performance of the proposed alignment technique is analyzed and compared with other search and alignment methods. The results show significant performance improvement with reduced search time.</data>

      <data key="title">holistic small cell traffic balancing across licensed and unlicensed bands</data>
      <data key="abstract">Due to the dramatic growth in mobile data traffic on one hand and the scarcity of the licensed spectrum on the other hand, mobile operators are considering the use of unlicensed bands (especially those in 5 GHz) as complementary spectrum for providing higher system capacity and better user experience. This approach is currently being standardized by 3GPP under the name of LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). In this paper, we take a holistic approach for LTE-LAA small cell traffic balancing by jointly optimizing the use of the licensed and unlicensed bands. We pose this traffic balancing as an optimization problem that seeks proportional fair coexistence of WiFi, small cell and macro cell users by adapting the transmission probability of the LTE-LAA small cell in the licensed and unlicensed bands. The motivation for this formulation is for the LTE-LAA small cell to switch between or aggregate licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the interference/traffic level and the number of active users in each band. We derive a closed form solution for this optimization problem and additionally propose a transmission mechanism for the operation of the LTE-LAA small cell on both bands. Through numerical and simulation results, we show that our proposed traffic balancing scheme, besides enabling better LTE-WiFi coexistence and efficient utilization of the radio resources relative to the existing traffic balancing scheme, also provides a better tradeoff between maximizing the total network throughput and achieving fairness among all network flows compared to alternative approaches.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper investigates the co-existence of Wi-Fi and LTE networks in emerging unlicensed frequency bands which are intended to accommodate multiple radio access technologies. Wi-Fi and LTE are the two most prominent wireless access technologies being deployed today, motivating further study of the inter-system interference arising in such shared spectrum scenarios as well as possible techniques for enabling improved co-existence. An analytical model for evaluating the baseline performance of co-existing Wi-Fi and LTE networks is developed and used to obtain baseline performance measures. The results show that both Wi-Fi and LTE networks cause significant interference to each other and that the degradation is dependent on a number of factors such as power levels and physical topology. The model-based results are partially validated via experimental evaluations using USRP-based SDR platforms on the ORBIT testbed. Further, inter-network coordination with logically centralized radio resource management across Wi-Fi and LTE systems is proposed as a possible solution for improved co-existence. Numerical results are presented showing significant gains in both Wi-Fi and LTE performance with the proposed inter-network coordination approach.</data>

      <data key="title">analysis of csat performance in wi fi and lte u coexistence</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we study energy-based Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) for use with LTE-U and investigate the performance in Wi-Fi/LTE-U coexistence using theoretical analysis and experimental verification using NI USRPs. According to the LTE-U forum specification, if an LTE-U base station (BS) finds a vacant channel, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF its transmission for only 1 ms, resulting in a maximum duty cycle of 95%. In a dense deployment of LTE-U and Wi-Fi, it is very likely that a Wi-Fi access point (AP) will wish to use the same channel. It will start transmission by trying to transmit association packets (using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)) through the 1 ms LTE-U OFF duration. Since this duration is very small, it leads to increased association packet drops and thus delays the Wi-Fi association process. Once LTE-U, using CSAT, detects Wi-Fi, it should scale back the duty cycle to 50%. We demonstrate in this paper, using an experimental platform as well as theoretical analysis, that if LTE-U is using a 95% duty cycle, energy based CSAT will take a much longer time to scale back the duty cycle due to the beacon drops and delays in the reception. Hence, in order to maintain association fairness with Wi-Fi, we propose that a LTE-U BS should not transmit at maximum duty cycles (95%), even if the channel is sensed to be vacant.</data>

      <data key="title">downlink interference estimation without feedback for heterogeneous network interference avoidance</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we present a novel method for a base station (BS) to estimate the total downlink interference power received by any given mobile receiver, without information feedback from the user or information exchange between neighbouring BSs. The prediction method is deterministic and can be computed rapidly. This is achieved by first abstracting the cellular network into a mathematical model, and then inferring the interference power received at any location based on the power spectrum measurements taken at the observing BS. The analysis expands the methodology to a K-tier heterogeneous network and demonstrates the accuracy of the technique for a variety of sampling densities. The paper demonstrates the methodology by applying it to an opportunistic transmission technique that avoids transmissions to channels which are overwhelmed by interference. The simulation results show that the proposed technique performs closely or better than existing interference avoidance techniques that require information exchange, and yields a 30% throughput improvement over baseline configurations.</data>

      <data key="title">inter technology coexistence in a spectrum commons a case study of wi fi and lte in the 5 ghz unlicensed band</data>
      <data key="abstract">Spectrum sharing mechanisms need to be carefully designed to enable inter-technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, as these bands are an instance of a  spectrum commons  where highly heterogeneous technologies and deployments must coexist. Unlike in licensed bands, where multiple technologies could coexist only in a primary–secondary dynamic spectrum access mode, a spectrum commons offers competition opportunities between multiple dominant technologies, such as Wi-Fi and the recently proposed LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for inter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a general framework for transparent comparative analysis of spectrum sharing mechanisms in time and frequency, by studying the effect of key constituent parameters. Second, we propose a novel throughput and interference model for inter-technology coexistence, integrating per-device specifics of different distributed MAC sharing mechanisms in a unified network-level perspective. Finally, we present a case study of IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi and LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, in order to obtain generalizable insight into coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our extensive Monte Carlo simulation results show that LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence in the 5 GHz band can be ensured simply through channel selection schemes, such that time-sharing MAC mechanisms are irrelevant. We also show that, in the general co-channel case, the coexistence performance of MAC sharing mechanisms strongly depends on the  interference coupling  in the network, predominantly determined by building shielding. We thus identify two regimes: (i) low interference coupling, e.g., residential indoor scenarios, where duty cycle mechanisms outperform sensing-based listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanisms and (ii) high interference coupling, e.g., open-plan indoor or outdoor hotspot scenarios, where LBT outperforms duty cycle mechanisms.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper devises a general modeling and analyzing framework for a heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet) in which several wireless subnetworks coexist and use multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs). The coexisting coverage and network capacity in such a multi-RAT HetNet are hardly investigated in prior works. To characterize the coexisting interactions in a multi-RAT HetNet, in this paper we consider a HetNet consisting of K-tier APs and two different RATs, RAT-L and RAT-U, are adopted in the HetNet. RAT-L is adopted by the access points (APs) in the first K-1 tiers and APs in the Kth tier only use RAT-U. Both noncrossing-RAT and crossing-RAT user association scenarios are considered. In each scenario, the void probability and channel access probability of the APs in each tier are first found and then the tight lower bounds and their lowest limits on the proposed coexisting coverage and network capacity are derived. We show that multi-RAT networks in general can achieve higher link coverage and capacity by using opportunistic CSMA/CA that avoids/alleviates severe interfering between all coexisting APs. Also, crossing-RAT user association is shown to achieve much higher coexisting coverage and network capacity than noncrossing-RAT user association. Finally, numerical simulations for the LTE-U and WiFi networks coexisting in the HetNet validate our findings.</data>

      <data key="title">proactive resource management for lte in unlicensed spectrum a deep learning perspective</data>
      <data key="abstract">LTE in unlicensed spectrum using licensed assisted access LTE (LTE-LAA) is a promising approach to overcome the wireless spectrum scarcity. However, to reap the benefits of LTE-LAA, a fair coexistence mechanism with other incumbent WiFi deployments is required. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach is proposed for modeling the resource allocation problem of LTE-LAA small base stations (SBSs). The proposed approach enables multiple SBSs to proactively perform dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation, and fractional spectrum access while guaranteeing fairness with existing WiFi networks and other LTE-LAA operators. Adopting a proactive coexistence mechanism enables future delay-tolerant LTE-LAA data demands to be served within a given prediction window ahead of their actual arrival time thus avoiding the underutilization of the unlicensed spectrum during off-peak hours while maximizing the total served LTE-LAA traffic load. To this end, a noncooperative game model is formulated in which SBSs are modeled as Homo Egualis agents that aim at predicting a sequence of future actions and thus achieving long-term equal weighted fairness with WLAN and other LTE-LAA operators over a given time horizon. The proposed deep learning algorithm is then shown to reach a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), when it converges. Simulation results using real data traces show that the proposed scheme can yield up to 28% and 11% gains over a conventional reactive approach and a proportional fair coexistence mechanism, respectively. The results also show that the proposed framework prevents WiFi performance degradation for a densely deployed LTE-LAA network.</data>

      <data key="title">coexistence of wi fi and heterogeneous small cell networks sharing unlicensed spectrum</data>
      <data key="abstract">As two major players in terrestrial wireless communications, Wi-Fi systems and cellular networks have different origins and have largely evolved separately. Motivated by the exponentially increasing wireless data demand, cellular networks are evolving towards a heterogeneous and small cell network architecture, wherein small cells are expected to provide very high capacity. However, due to the limited licensed spectrum for cellular networks, any effort to achieve capacity growth through network densification will face the challenge of severe inter-cell interference. In view of this, recent standardization developments have started to consider the opportunities for cellular networks to use the unlicensed spectrum bands, including the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands that are currently used by Wi-Fi, Zigbee and some other communication systems. In this article, we look into the coexistence of Wi-Fi and 4G cellular networks sharing the unlicensed spectrum. We introduce a network architecture where small cells use the same unlicensed spectrum that Wi-Fi systems operate in without affecting the performance of Wi-Fi systems. We present an almost blank subframe (ABS) scheme without priority to mitigate the co-channel interference from small cells to Wi-Fi systems, and propose an interference avoidance scheme based on small cells estimating the density of nearby Wi-Fi access points to facilitate their coexistence while sharing the same unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results show that the proposed network architecture and interference avoidance schemes can significantly increase the capacity of 4G heterogeneous cellular networks while maintaining the service quality of Wi-Fi systems.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper elaborates on the design challenges, opportunities, and solutions for New Radio-based access to Unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) by taking into account the beam-based transmissions and the worldwide regulatory requirements. NR-U intends to expand the applicability of 5th generation New Radio access technology to support operation in unlicensed bands by adhering to Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) requirements for accessing the channel. LBT was already adopted by different variants of 4th generation Long Term Evolution (LTE) in unlicensed spectrum, i.e., Licensed-Assisted Access and MulteFire, to guarantee fair coexistence among different radio access technologies. In the case of beam-based transmissions, the NR-U coexistence framework is significantly different as compared to LTE in unlicensed spectrum due to the use of directional antennas, which enhance the spatial reuse but also complicate the interference management. In particular, beam-based transmissions are needed in the unlicensed spectrum at millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, which is an attractive candidate for NR-U due to its large amount of allocated spectrum. As a consequence, some major design principles need to be revisited to address coexistence for beam-based NR-U. In this paper, different problems and the potential solutions related to channel access procedures, frame structure, initial access procedures, re-transmission procedures, and scheduling schemes are discussed. A simulation evaluation of different LBT-based channel access procedures for NR-U/Wi-Fi indoor mmWave coexistence scenarios is also provided.</data>
