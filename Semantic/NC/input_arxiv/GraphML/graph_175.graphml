      <data key="title">error rate analysis of cognitive radio transmissions with imperfect channel sensing</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper studies the symbol error rate performance of cognitive radio transmissions in the presence of imperfect sensing decisions. Two different transmission schemes, namely sensing-based spectrum sharing (SSS) and opportunistic spectrum access (OSA), are considered. In both schemes, secondary users first perform channel sensing, albeit with possible errors. In SSS, depending on the sensing decisions, they adapt the transmission power level and coexist with primary users in the channel. On the other hand, in OSA, secondary users are allowed to transmit only when the primary user activity is not detected. Initially, for both transmission schemes, general formulations for the optimal decision rule and error probabilities are provided for arbitrary modulation schemes under the assumptions that the receiver is equipped with the sensing decision and perfect knowledge of the channel fading, and the primary user's received faded signals at the secondary receiver has a Gaussian mixture distribution. Subsequently, the general approach is specialized to rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). More specifically, optimal decision rule is characterized for rectangular QAM, and closed-form expressions for the average symbol error probability attained with the optimal detector are derived under both transmit power and interference constraints. The effects of imperfect channel sensing decisions, interference from the primary user and its Gaussian mixture model, and the transmit power and interference constraints on the error rate performance of cognitive transmissions are analyzed.</data>

      <data key="title">green cognitive relaying opportunistically switching between data transmission and energy harvesting</data>
      <data key="abstract">Energy efficiency has become an encouragement, and more than this, a requisite for the design of next-generation wireless communications standards. In current work, a dual-hop cognitive (secondary) relaying system is considered, incorporating multiple amplify-and-forward relays, a rather cost-effective solution. First, the secondary relays sense the wireless channel, scanning for a primary network activity, and then convey their reports to a secondary base station (SBS). Afterwards, the SBS, based on these reports and its own estimation, decides cooperatively the presence of primary transmission or not. In the former scenario, all the secondary nodes start to harvest energy from the transmission of primary node(s). In the latter scenario, the system initiates secondary communication via a best relay selection policy. Performance evaluation of this system is thoroughly investigated, by assuming realistic channel conditions, i.e., non-identical link-distances, Rayleigh fading, and outdated channel estimation. The detection and outage probabilities as well as the average harvested energy are derived as new closed-form expressions. In addition, an energy efficiency optimization problem is analytically formulated and solved, while a necessary condition in terms of power consumption minimization for each secondary node is presented. From a green communications standpoint, it turns out that energy harvesting greatly enhances the resources of secondary nodes, especially when primary activity is densely present.</data>

      <data key="title">relaying protocols for wireless energy harvesting and information processing</data>
      <data key="abstract">An emerging solution for prolonging the lifetime of energy constrained relay nodes in wireless networks is to avail the ambient radio-frequency (RF) signal and to simultaneously harvest energy and process information. In this paper, an amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying network is considered, where an energy constrained relay node harvests energy from the received RF signal and uses that harvested energy to forward the source information to the destination. Based on the time switching and power splitting receiver architectures, two relaying protocols, namely, i) time switching-based relaying (TSR) protocol and ii) power splitting-based relaying (PSR) protocol are proposed to enable energy harvesting and information processing at the relay. In order to determine the throughput, analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic capacity are derived for delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes, respectively. The numerical analysis provides practical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such as energy harvesting time, power splitting ratio, source transmission rate, source to relay distance, noise power, and energy harvesting efficiency, on the performance of wireless energy harvesting and information processing using AF relay nodes. In particular, the TSR protocol outperforms the PSR protocol in terms of throughput at relatively low signal-to-noise-ratios and high transmission rates.</data>

      <data key="title">opportunistic wireless energy harvesting in cognitive radio networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wireless networks can be self-sustaining by harvesting energy from ambient radio-frequency (RF) signals. Recently, researchers have made progress on designing efficient circuits and devices for RF energy harvesting suitable for low-power wireless applications. Motivated by this and building upon the classic cognitive radio (CR) network model, this paper proposes a novel method for wireless networks coexisting where low-power mobiles in a secondary network, called secondary transmitters (STs), harvest ambient RF energy from transmissions by nearby active transmitters in a primary network, called primary transmitters (PTs), while opportunistically accessing the spectrum licensed to the primary network. We consider a stochastic-geometry model in which PTs and STs are distributed as independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs) and communicate with their intended receivers at fixed distances. Each PT is associated with a guard zone to protect its intended receiver from ST's interference, and at the same time delivers RF energy to STs located in its harvesting zone. Based on the proposed model, we analyze the transmission probability of STs and the resulting spatial throughput of the secondary network. The optimal transmission power and density of STs are derived for maximizing the secondary network throughput under the given outage-probability constraints in the two coexisting networks, which reveal key insights to the optimal network design. Finally, we show that our analytical result can be generally applied to a non-CR setup, where distributed wireless power chargers are deployed to power coexisting wireless transmitters in a sensor network.</data>

      <data key="title">cognitive energy harvesting and transmission from a network perspective</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wireless networks can be self-sustaining by harvesting energy from radio-frequency (RF) signals. Building on classic cognitive radio networks, we propose a novel method for network coexisting where mobiles from a secondary network, called secondary transmitters (STs), either harvest energy from transmissions by nearby transmitters from a primary network, called primary transmitters (PTs), or transmit information if PTs are sufficiently far away; STs store harvested energy in rechargeable batteries with finite capacity and use all available energy for subsequent transmission when batteries are fully charged. In this model, each PT is centered at a guard zone and a harvesting zone that are disks with given radiuses; a ST harvests energy if it lies in some harvesting zone, transmits fixed-power signals if it is outside all guard zones or else idles. Based on this model, the spatial throughput of the secondary network is maximized using a stochastic-geometry model where PTs and STs are modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs), under the outage constraints for coexisting networks and obtained in a simple closed-form. It is observed from the result that the maximum secondary throughput decreases linearly with the growing PT density, and the optimal ST density is inversely proportional to the derived transmission probability for STs.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has great potential to manage the rapid growth of wireless data traffic. Massive MIMO achieves tremendous spectral efficiency by spatial multiplexing many tens of user equipments (UEs). These gains are only achieved in practice if many more UEs can connect efficiently to the network than today. As the number of UEs increases, while each UE intermittently accesses the network, the random access functionality becomes essential to share the limited number of pilots among the UEs. In this paper, we revisit the random access problem in the Massive MIMO context and develop a reengineered protocol, termed  strongest-user collision resolution  (SUCRe). An accessing UE asks for a dedicated pilot by sending an uncoordinated random access pilot, with a risk that other UEs send the same pilot. The favorable propagation of massive MIMO channels is utilized to enable distributed collision detection at each UE, thereby determining the strength of the contenders’ signals and deciding to repeat the pilot if the UE judges that its signal at the receiver is the strongest. The SUCRe protocol resolves the vast majority of all pilot collisions in crowded urban scenarios and continues to admit UEs efficiently in overloaded networks.</data>

      <data key="title">simultaneous information and energy transfer in large scale networks with without relaying</data>
      <data key="abstract">Energy harvesting (EH) from ambient radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves is an efficient solution for fully autonomous and sustainable communication networks. Most of the related works presented in the literature are based on specific (and small-scale) network structures, which although give useful insights on the potential benefits of the RF-EH technology, cannot characterize the performance of general networks. In this paper, we adopt a large-scale approach of the RF-EH technology and we characterize the performance of a network with random number of transmitter-receiver pairs by using stochastic-geometry tools. Specifically, we analyze the outage probability performance and the average harvested energy, when receivers employ power splitting (PS) technique for "simultaneous" information and energy transfer. A non-cooperative scheme, where information/energy are conveyed only via direct links, is firstly considered and the outage performance of the system as well as the average harvested energy are derived in closed form in function of the power splitting. For this protocol, an interesting optimization problem which minimizes the transmitted power under outage probability and harvesting constraints, is formulated and solved in closed form. In addition, we study a cooperative protocol where sources' transmissions are supported by a random number of potential relays that are randomly distributed into the network. In this case, information/energy can be received at each destination via two independent and orthogonal paths (in case of relaying). We characterize both performance metrics, when a selection combining scheme is applied at the receivers and a single relay is randomly selected for cooperative diversity.</data>

      <data key="title">green power control in cognitive wireless networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">A decentralized network of cognitive and noncognitive transmitters where each transmitter aims at maximizing his energy efficiency is considered. The cognitive transmitters are assumed to be able to sense the transmit power of their noncognitive counterparts and the former have a cost for sensing. The Stackelberg equilibrium analysis of this two-level hierarchical game is conducted, which allows us to better understand the effects of cognition on energy efficiency. In particular, it is proven that the network energy efficiency is maximized when only a given fraction of terminals are cognitive. Then, we study a sensing game where all the transmitters are assumed to take the decision of whether to sense (namely to be cognitive) or not. This game is shown to be a weighted potential game, and its set of equilibria is studied. Playing the sensing game in a first phase (e.g., of a time slot) and then playing the power control game is shown to be more efficient individually for all transmitters than playing a game where a transmitter would jointly optimize whether to sense his power level, showing the existence of a kind of Braess paradox. The derived results are illustrated by numerical results and provide some insights on how to deploy cognitive radios in heterogeneous networks in terms of sensing capabilities.</data>

      <data key="title">achieving autonomous compressive spectrum sensing for cognitive radios</data>
      <data key="abstract">Compressive sensing (CS) technologies present many advantages over other existing approaches for implementing wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radios (CRs), such as reduced sampling rate and computational complexity. However, there are two significant challenges: 1) choosing an appropriate number of sub-Nyquist measurements and 2) deciding when to terminate the greedy recovery algorithm that reconstructs wideband spectrum. In this paper, an autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that enables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while guaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery error. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the validation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with high confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and noisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery (SASR) algorithm is proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the instantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap between CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that ACSS not only can recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of measurements but can considerably improve the spectral recovery performance as well, compared with existing CS approaches. The proposed recovery algorithm can autonomously adopt a proper number of iterations, therefore solving the problems of underfitting or overfitting, which commonly exist in most greedy recovery algorithms.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, a new interweave cognitive radio (CR) transmission scheme is analytically presented for energy harvesting (EH)-enabled transmitting nodes. EH is performed via a dedicated power beacon (PB) base station through wireless power transfer, which harvests energy to both primary and secondary systems. The out-band mode-of-operation between PB and the two heterogeneous systems is considered (i.e., data communication and EH are realized at different frequency bands). The performance of the new interweave CR system is studied under independent and not necessarily identically distributed $\kappa-\mu$ shadowed faded channels.

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, the performance of an underlay multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio system is analytically studied. In particular, the secondary transmitter operates in a spatial multiplexing transmission mode, while a zero-forcing (ZF) detector is employed at the secondary receiver. Additionally, the secondary system is interfered by multiple randomly distributed single-antenna primary users (PUs). To enhance the performance of secondary transmission, optimal power allocation is performed at the secondary transmitter with a constraint on the interference temperature (IT) specified by the PUs. The outage probability of the secondary receiver is explicitly derived in an exact closed-form expression. Also, some special cases of practical interest, including co-located PUs and massive MIMO, are discussed. Further, to mitigate instantaneous excessive interference onto PUs caused by the time-average IT, an iterative antenna reduction algorithm is developed for the secondary transmitter and, accordingly, the average number of transmit antennas is analytically computed. Extensive numerical and simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our analysis.</data>

      <data key="title">wireless information and energy transfer in multi antenna interference channel</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper considers the transmitter design for wireless information and energy transfer (WIET) in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel (IFC). The design problem is to maximize the system throughput subject to individual energy harvesting constraints and power constraints. It is observed that the ideal scheme, where the receivers simultaneously perform information detection (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) from the received signal, may not always achieve the best tradeoff between information transfer and energy harvesting, but simple practical schemes based on time splitting may perform better. We therefore propose two practical time splitting schemes, namely the time-division mode switching (TDMS) and time-division multiple access (TDMA), in addition to the existing power splitting (PS) scheme. In the two-user scenario, we show that beamforming is optimal to all the schemes. Moreover, the design problems associated with the TDMS and TDMA schemes admit semi-analytical solutions. In the general K-user scenario, a successive convex approximation method is proposed to handle the WIET problems associated with the ideal scheme, the PS scheme and the TDMA scheme, which are known NP-hard in general. Simulation results show that none of the schemes under consideration can always dominate another in terms of the sum rate performance. Specifically, it is observed that stronger cross-link channel power improves the achievable sum rate of time splitting schemes but degrades the sum rate performance of the ideal scheme and PS scheme. As a result, time splitting schemes can outperform the ideal scheme and the PS scheme in interference dominated scenarios.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, a wireless cooperative network is considered, in which multiple source-destination pairs communicate with each other via an energy harvesting relay. The focus of this paper is on the relay's strategies to distribute the harvested energy among the multiple users and their impact on the system performance. Specifically, a non-cooperative strategy that uses the energy harvested from the i-th source as the relay transmission power to the i-th destination is considered first, and asymptotic results show that its outage performance decays as log SNR/SNR. A faster decay rate, 1/SNR, can be achieved by two centralized strategies proposed next, of which a water filling based one can achieve optimal performance with respect to several criteria, at the price of high complexity. An auction based power allocation scheme is also proposed to achieve a better tradeoff between system performance and complexity.

      <data key="abstract">In the present contribution, we propose a novel opportunistic ambient backscatter communication (ABC) framework for radio frequency (RF)-powered cognitive radio (CR) networks. This framework considers opportunistic spectrum sensing integrated with ABC and harvest-then-transmit (HTT) operation strategies. Novel analytic expressions are derived for the average throughput, the average energy consumption and the energy efficiency in the considered set up. These expressions are represented in closed-form and have a tractable algebraic representation which renders them convenient to handle both analytically and numerically. In addition, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the energy efficiency of the CR system operating in mixed ABC $-$ and HTT $-$ modes, for a given set of constraints including primary interference and imperfect spectrum sensing constraints. Capitalizing on this, we determine the optimal set of parameters which in turn comprise the optimal detection threshold, the optimal degree of trade-off between the CR system operating in the ABC $-$ and HTT $-$ modes and the optimal data transmission time. Extensive results from respective computer simulations are also presented for corroborating the corresponding analytic results and to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed model in terms of energy efficiency.</data>

      <data key="title">wireless information and power transfer a dynamic power splitting approach</data>
      <data key="abstract">Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called "rate-energy (R-E)" region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. The achievable R-E region by the proposed DPS scheme is also compared against that by the existing time switching scheme as well as a performance upper bound by ignoring the practical receiver constraint. Finally, we extend the result for optimal DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system where the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. In particular, we investigate a low-complexity power splitting scheme, namely antenna switching, which achieves the near-optimal rate-energy trade-offs as compared to the optimal DPS.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, an energy harvesting dual-hop relaying system without/with the presence of co-channel interference (CCI) is investigated. Specifically, the energy constrained multi-antenna relay node is powered by either the information signal of the source or via the signal receiving from both the source and interferer. In particular, we first study the outage probability and ergodic capacity of an interference free system, and then extend the analysis to an interfering environment. To exploit the benefit of multiple antennas, three different linear processing schemes are investigated, namely, 1) Maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission (MRC/MRT), 2) Zero-forcing/MRT (ZF/MRT) and 3) Minimum mean-square error/MRT (MMSE/MRT). For all schemes, both the systems outage probability and ergodic capacity are studied, and the achievable diversity order is also presented. In addition, the optimal power splitting ratio minimizing the outage probability is characterized. Our results show that the implementation of multiple antennas increases the energy harvesting capability, hence, significantly improves the systems performance. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the CCI could be potentially exploited to substantially boost the performance, while the choice of a linear processing scheme plays a critical role in determining how much gain could be extracted from the CCI.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this work we study energy-efficient transmission for Cognitive Radio (CR) which opportunistically operates on Primary User's (PU's) channel through spectrum sensing. Spectrum sensing and compulsory idling (for incumbent protection) introduce energy-overheads for Secondary User's (SU's) operations, and thus an appropriate balance between energy consumption in data transmission and energy-overheads is required. We formulate this problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which the SU aims at minimizing its average cost (including both energy consumption and delay cost) to finish a target traffic payload through an appropriate rate allocation. Based on Certainty Equivalent Control, we propose a low-complexity rate-adaptation policy that achieves comparable performance as the optimal policy. With the low-complexity policy, we quantify the impact of energy-overheads (including the power consumption for spectrum sensing and compulsory idling) on the SU transmission strategy. Specifically, the SU rate increases with the increase of energy-overheads, whose marginal impact, however, diminishes. Moreover, the marginal impact of energy-overheads is more significant for delay-insensitive traffic compared to that for delay-sensitive traffic. To mitigate the loss due to imperfect spectrum sensing, we quantify that the SU decreases (increases) its rate with a larger mis-detection probability (false alarm probability).</data>
