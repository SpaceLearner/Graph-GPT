      <data key="abstract">This paper introduces the concept of Conjectural Link for Complex Networks, in particular, social networks. Conjectural Link we understand as an implicit link, not available in the network, but supposed to be present, based on the characteristics of its topology. It is possible, for example, when in the formal description of the network some connections are skipped due to errors, deliberately hidden or withdrawn (e.g. in the case of partial destruction of the network).</data>

      <data key="abstract">The identification of influential nodes in complex network can be very challenging. If the network has a community structure, centrality measures may fail to identify the complete set of influential nodes, as the hubs and other central nodes of the network may lie inside only one community. Here we define a bipartite clustering coefficient that, by taking differently structured clusters into account, can find important nodes across communities.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Social studies researchers use graphs to model group activities in social networks. An important property in this context is the centrality of a vertex: the inverse of the average distance to each other vertex. We describe a randomized approximation algorithm for centrality in weighted graphs. For graphs exhibiting the small world phenomenon, our method estimates the centrality of all vertices with high probability within a (1+epsilon) factor in near-linear time.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Tracing criminal ties and mining evidence from a large network to begin a crime case analysis has been difficult for criminal investigators due to large numbers of nodes and their complex relationships. In this paper, trust networks using blind carbon copy (BCC) emails were formed. We show that our new shortest paths network search algorithm combining shortest paths and network centrality measures can isolate and identify criminals' connections within a trust network. A group of BCC emails out of 1,887,305 Enron email transactions were isolated for this purpose. The algorithm uses two central nodes, most influential and middle man, to extract a shortest paths trust network.</data>

      <data key="title">fast extraction of the backbone of projected bipartite networks to aid community detection</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper introduces a computationally inexpensive method for extracting the backbone of one-mode networks projected from bipartite networks. We show that the edge weights in the one-mode projections are distributed according to a Poisson binomial distribution and that finding the expected weight distribution of a one-mode network projected from a random bipartite network only requires knowledge of the bipartite degree distributions. Being able to extract the backbone of a projection is highly beneficial in filtering out redundant information in large complex networks and narrowing down the information in the one-mode projection to the most relevant. We demonstrate that the backbone of a one-mode projection aids in the detection of communities.</data>

      <data key="title">the minimum wiener connector problem</data>
      <data key="abstract">The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of all pairwise shortest-path distances between its vertices. In this paper we study the novel problem of finding a minimum Wiener connector: given a connected graph G=(V,E) and a set Q ⊆ V of query vertices, find a subgraph of G that connects all query vertices and has minimum Wiener index.   We show that MIN WIENER CONNECTOR admits a polynomial-time (albeit impractical) exact algorithm for the special case where the number of query vertices is bounded. We show that in general the problem is NP-hard, and has no PTAS unless P = NP. Our main contribution is a constant-factor approximation algorithm running in time O(|Q||E|).   A thorough experimentation on a large variety of real-world graphs confirms that our method returns smaller and denser solutions than other methods, and does so by adding to the query set Q a small number of ``important'' vertices (i.e., vertices with high centrality).</data>

      <data key="title">forensic analysis of phone call networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In the context of preventing and fighting crime, the analysis of mobile phone traffic, among actors of a criminal network, is helpful in order to reconstruct illegal activities on the basis of the relationships connecting those specific individuals. Thus, forensic analysts and investigators require new advanced tools and techniques which allow them to manage these data in a meaningful and efficient way. In this paper we present LogAnalysis, a tool we developed to provide visual data representation and filtering, statistical analysis features and the possibility of a temporal analysis of mobile phone activities. Its adoption may help in unveiling the structure of a criminal network and the roles and dynamics of communications among its components. Using LogAnalysis, forensic investigators could deeply understand hierarchies within criminal organizations, for e.g., discovering central members who provide connections among different sub-groups, etc. Moreover, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the contacts among individuals, or by focusing on specific time windows they could acquire additional insights on the data they are analyzing. Finally, we put into evidence how the adoption of LogAnalysis may be crucial to solve real cases, providing as example a number of case studies inspired by real forensic investigations led by one of the authors.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Clustering and community structure is crucial for many network systems and the related dynamic processes. It has been shown that communities are usually overlapping and hierarchical. However, previous methods investigate these two properties of community structure separately. This paper proposes an algorithm (EAGLE) to detect both the overlapping and hierarchical properties of complex community structure together. This algorithm deals with the set of maximal cliques and adopts an agglomerative framework. The quality function of modularity is extended to evaluate the goodness of a cover. The examples of application to real world networks give excellent results.</data>

      <data key="title">ranking the importance level of intermediaries to a criminal using a reliance measure</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recent research on finding important intermediate nodes in a network suspected to contain criminal activity is highly dependent on network centrality values. Betweenness centrality, for example, is widely used to rank the nodes that act as brokers in the shortest paths connecting all source and all the end nodes in a network. However both the shortest path node betweenness and the linearly scaled betweenness can only show rankings for all the nodes in a network. In this paper we explore the mathematical concept of pair-dependency on intermediate nodes, adapting the concept to criminal relationships and introducing a new source-intermediate reliance measure. To illustrate our measure, we apply it to rank the nodes in the Enron email dataset and the Noordin Top Terrorist networks. We compare the reliance ranking with Google PageRank, Markov centrality as well as betweenness centrality and show that a criminal investigation using the reliance measure, will lead to a different prioritisation in terms of possible people to investigate. While the ranking for the Noordin Top terrorist network nodes yields more extreme differences than for the Enron email transaction network, in the latter the reliance values for the set of finance managers immediately identified another employee convicted of money laundering.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Anomalies in online social networks can signify irregular, and often illegal behaviour. Anomalies in online social networks can signify irregular, and often illegal behaviour. Detection of such anomalies has been used to identify malicious individuals, including spammers, sexual predators, and online fraudsters. In this paper we survey existing computational techniques for detecting anomalies in online social networks. We characterise anomalies as being either static or dynamic, and as being labelled or unlabelled, and survey methods for detecting these different types of anomalies. We suggest that the detection of anomalies in online social networks is composed of two sub-processes; the selection and calculation of network features, and the classification of observations from this feature space. In addition, this paper provides an overview of the types of problems that anomaly detection can address and identifies key areas of future research.</data>

      <data key="title">predicting item popularity analysing local clustering behaviour of users</data>
      <data key="abstract">Predicting the popularity of items in rating networks is an interesting but challenging problem. This is especially so when an item has first appeared and has received very few ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the future popularity of new items in rating networks, defining a new bipartite clustering coefficient to predict the popularity of movies and stories in the MovieLens and Digg networks respectively. We show that the clustering behaviour of the first user who rates a new item gives insight into the future popularity of that item. Our method predicts, with a success rate of over 65% for the MovieLens network and over 50% for the Digg network, the future popularity of an item. This is a major improvement on current results.</data>

      <data key="title">on the fairness of time critical influence maximization in social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Influence maximization has found applications in a wide range of real-world problems, for instance, viral marketing of products in an online social network, and information propagation of valuable information such as job vacancy advertisements and health-related information. While existing algorithmic techniques usually aim at maximizing the total number of people influenced, the population often comprises several socially salient groups, e.g., based on gender or race. As a result, these techniques could lead to disparity across different groups in receiving important information. Furthermore, in many of these applications, the spread of influence is time-critical, i.e., it is only beneficial to be influenced before a time deadline. As we show in this paper, the time-criticality of the information could further exacerbate the disparity of influence across groups. This disparity, introduced by algorithms aimed at maximizing total influence, could have far-reaching consequences, impacting people's prosperity and putting minority groups at a big disadvantage. In this work, we propose a notion of group fairness in time-critical influence maximization. We introduce surrogate objective functions to solve the influence maximization problem under fairness considerations. By exploiting the submodularity structure of our objectives, we provide computationally efficient algorithms with guarantees that are effective in enforcing fairness during the propagation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through synthetic and real-world experiments.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Distributed graph platforms like Pregel have usedvertex-centric programming models to process the growing cor-pus of graph datasets using commodity clusters. However, theirregular structure of graphs causes load imbalances acrossmachines, and this is exacerbated for non-stationary graphalgorithms where not all parts of the graph are active at thesame time. As a result, such graph platforms do not make efficientuse of distributed resources. In this paper, we decouple graphpartitioning from placement on hosts, and introduce strategiesfor elastic placement of graph partitions on Cloud VMs to reducethe cost of execution compared to a static placement, even aswe minimize the increase in makespan. These strategies areinnovative in modeling the graph algorithm's non-stationarybehavior a priori using a metagraph sketch. We validate ourstrategies for several real-world graphs, using runtime tracesfor approximate Betweenness Centrality (BC) algorithm on oursubgraph-centric GoFFish graph platform. Our strategies areable to reduce the cost of execution by up to 54%, comparedto a static placement, while achieving a makespan that is within25% of the optimal.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Abstract   The study of criminal networks using traces from heterogeneous communication media is acquiring increasing importance in nowadays society. The usage of communication media such as mobile phones and online social networks leaves digital traces in the form of metadata that can be used for this type of analysis. The goal of this work is twofold: first we provide a theoretical framework for the problem of detecting and characterizing criminal organizations in networks reconstructed from phone call records. Then, we introduce an expert system to support law enforcement agencies in the task of unveiling the underlying structure of criminal networks hidden in communication data. This platform allows for statistical network analysis, community detection and visual exploration of mobile phone network data. It enables forensic investigators to deeply understand hierarchies within criminal organizations, discovering members who play central role and provide connection among sub-groups. Our work concludes illustrating the adoption of our computational framework for a real-word criminal investigation.</data>

      <data key="title">using shortest path to discover criminal community</data>
      <data key="abstract">Extracting communities using existing community detection algorithms yields dense sub-networks that are difficult to analyse. Extracting a smaller sample that embodies the relationships of a list of suspects is an important part of the beginning of an investigation. In this paper, we present the efficacy of our shortest paths network search algorithm (SPNSA) that begins with an 'algorithm feed', a small subset of nodes of particular interest, and builds an investigative sub-network. The algorithm feed may consist of known criminals or suspects, or persons of influence. This sets our approach apart from existing community detection algorithms. We apply the SPNSA on the Enron Dataset of e-mail communications starting with those convicted of money laundering in relation to the collapse of Enron as the algorithm feed. The algorithm produces sparse and small sub-networks that could feasibly identify a list of persons and relationships to be further investigated. In contrast, we show that identifying sub-networks of interest using either existing community detection algorithms or a k-Neighbourhood approach produces sub-networks of much larger size and complexity. When the 18 top managers of Enron were used as the algorithm feed, the resulting sub-network identified 4 convicted criminals that were not managers and so not part of the algorithm feed. We directly validate the SPNSA by removing one of the convicted criminals from the algorithm feed and re-running the algorithm; in 5 out of 9 cases the left out criminal occurred in the resulting sub-network.</data>

      <data key="title">a novel measure of edge centrality in social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">The problem of assigning centrality values to nodes and edges in graphs has been widely investigated during last years. Recently, a novel measure of node centrality has been proposed, called @k-path centrality index, which is based on the propagation of messages inside a network along paths consisting of at most @k edges. On the other hand, the importance of computing the centrality of edges has been put into evidence since 1970s by Anthonisse and, subsequently by Girvan and Newman. In this work we propose the generalization of the concept of @k-path centrality by defining the @k-path edge centrality, a measure of centrality introduced to compute the importance of edges. We provide an efficient algorithm, running in O(@km), being m the number of edges in the graph. Thus, our technique is feasible for large scale network analysis. Finally, the performance of our algorithm is analyzed, discussing the results obtained against large online social network datasets.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We consider the all pairs all shortest paths (APASP) problem, which maintains all of the multiple shortest paths for every vertex pair in a directed graph G=(V,E) with a positive real weight on each edge. We present a fully dynamic algorithm for this problem in which an update supports either weight increases or weight decreases on a subset of edges incident to a vertex. Our algorithm runs in amortized O(\vstar^2 \cdot \log^3 n) time per update, where n = |V|, and \vstar bounds the number of edges that lie on shortest paths through any single vertex. Our APASP algorithm leads to the same amortized bound for the fully dynamic computation of betweenness centrality (BC), which is a parameter widely used in the analysis of large complex networks. #R##N#Our method is a generalization and a variant of the fully dynamic algorithm of Demetrescu and Italiano [DI04] for unique shortest path, and it builds on very recent work on decremental APASP [NPR14]. Our algorithm matches the fully dynamic amortized bound in [DI04] for graphs with unique shortest paths, though our method, and especially its analysis, are different.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Web caches, content distribution networks, peer-to-peer file sharing networks, distributed file systems, and data grids all have in common that they involve a community of users who generate requests for shared data. In each case, overall system performance can be improved significantly if we can first identify and then exploit interesting structure within a community's access patterns. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on file sharing based on the study of the relationships that form among users based on the files in which they are interested. #R##N#We propose a new structure that captures common user interests in data--the data-sharing graph-- and justify its utility with studies on three data-distribution systems: a high-energy physics collaboration, the Web, and the Kazaa peer-to-peer network. We find small-world patterns in the data-sharing graphs of all three communities. We analyze these graphs and propose some probable causes for these emergent small-world patterns. The significance of small-world patterns is twofold: it provides a rigorous support to intuition and, perhaps most importantly, it suggests ways to design mechanisms that exploit these naturally emerging patterns.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper proposes an alternative way to identify nodes with high betweenness centrality. It introduces a new metric, κ-path centrality, and a randomized algorithm for estimating it, and shows empirically that nodes with high κ-path centrality have high node betweenness centrality. The randomized algorithm runs in time O(κ3n2−2αlog n) and outputs, for each vertex v, an estimate of its κ-path centrality up to additive error of ±n1/2+α with probability 1 − 1/n2. Experimental evaluations on real and synthetic social networks show improved accuracy in detecting high betweenness centrality nodes and significantly reduced execution time when compared with existing randomized algorithms.</data>

      <data key="title">hellrank a hellinger based centrality measure for bipartite social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Measuring centrality in a social network, especially in bipartite mode, poses many challenges, for example, the requirement of full knowledge of the network topology, and the lack of properly detecting top-k behavioral representative users. To overcome the above mentioned challenges, we propose HellRank, an accurate centrality measure for identifying central nodes in bipartite social networks. HellRank is based on the Hellinger distance between two nodes on the same side of a bipartite network. We theoretically analyze the impact of this distance on a bipartite network and find upper and lower bounds for it. The computation of the HellRank centrality measure can be distributed, by letting each node uses local information only on its immediate neighbors. Consequently, one does not need a central entity that has full knowledge of the network topological structure. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the HellRank measure in correlation with other centrality measures on real-world networks. The results show partial ranking similarity between the HellRank and the other conventional metrics according to the Kendall and Spearman rank correlation coefficient.</data>
