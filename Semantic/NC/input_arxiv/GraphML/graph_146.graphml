      <data key="title">an analysis of device free and device based wifi localization systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">WiFi-based localization became one of the main indoor localization techniques due to the ubiquity of WiFi connectivity. However, indoor environments exhibit complex wireless propagation characteristics. Typically, these characteristics are captured by constructing a fingerprint map for the different locations in the area of interest. This finger print requires significant overhead in manual construction, and thus has been one of the major drawbacks of WiFi-based localization. In this paper, the authors present an automated tool for finger print constructions and leverage it to study novel scenarios for device-based and device-free WiFi-based localization that are difficult to evaluate in a real environment. In a particular, the authors examine the effect of changing the access points AP mounting location, AP technology upgrade, crowd effect on calibration and operation, among others; on the accuracy of the localization system. The authors present the analysis for the two classes of WiFi-based localization: device-based and device-free. The authors analysis highlights factors affecting the localization system accuracy, how to tune it for better localization, and provides insights for both researchers and practitioners.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present Dejavu, a system that uses standard cell-phone sensors to provide accurate and energy-efficient outdoor localization suitable for car navigation. Our analysis shows that different road landmarks have a unique signature on cell-phone sensors; For example, going inside tunnels, moving over bumps, going up a bridge, and even potholes all affect the inertial sensors on the phone in a unique pattern. Dejavu employs a dead-reckoning localization approach and leverages these road landmarks, among other automatically discovered abundant virtual landmarks, to reset the accumulated error and achieve accurate localization. To maintain a low energy profile, Dejavu uses only energy-efficient sensors or sensors that are already running for other purposes. We present the design of Dejavu and how it leverages crowd-sourcing to automatically learn virtual landmarks and their locations. Our evaluation results from implementation on different android devices in both city and highway driving show that Dejavu can localize cell phones to within 8.4m median error in city roads and 16.6m on highways. Moreover, compared to GPS and other state-of-the-art systems, Dejavu can extend the battery lifetime by 347%, achieving even better localization results than GPS in the more challenging in-city driving conditions.</data>

      <data key="title">map a crowd sensing system for automatic map semantics identification</data>
      <data key="abstract">Digital maps have become a part of our daily life with a number of commercial and free map services. These services have still a huge potential for enhancement with rich semantic information to support a large class of mapping applications. In this paper, we present Map++, a system that leverages standard cell-phone sensors in a crowdsensing approach to automatically enrich digital maps with different road semantics like tunnels, bumps, bridges, footbridges, crosswalks, road capacity, among others. Our analysis shows that cell-phones sensors with humans in vehicles or walking get affected by the different road features, which can be mined to extend the features of both free and commercial mapping services. We present the design and implementation of Map++ and evaluate it in a large city. Our evaluation shows that we can detect the different semantics accurately with at most 3% false positive rate and 6% false negative rate for both vehicle and pedestrian-based features. Moreover, we show that Map++ has a small energy footprint on the cell-phones, highlighting its promise as a ubiquitous digital maps enriching service.</data>

      <data key="title">spot an accurate and efficient multi entity device free wlan localization system</data>
      <data key="abstract">Device-free (DF) localization in WLANs has been introduced as a value-added service that allows tracking indoor entities that do not carry any devices. Previous work in DF WLAN localization focused on the tracking of a single entity due to the intractability of the multi-entity tracking problem whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of humans being tracked. In this paper, we introduce Spot as an accurate and efficient system for multi-entity DF detection and tracking. Spot is based on a probabilistic energy minimization framework that combines a conditional random field with a Markov model to capture the temporal and spatial relations between the entities' poses. A novel cross-calibration technique is introduced to reduce the calibration overhead of multiple entities to linear, regardless of the number of humans being tracked. This also helps in increasing the system accuracy. We design the energy minimization function with the goal of being efficiently solved in mind. We show that the designed function can be mapped to a binary graph-cut problem whose solution has a linear complexity on average and a third order polynomial in the worst case. We further employ clustering on the estimated location candidates to reduce outliers and obtain more accurate tracking. Experimental evaluation in two typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the state-of-the-art, shows that Spot can achieve a multi-entity tracking accuracy of less than 1.1m. This corresponds to at least 36% enhancement in median distance error over the state-of-the-art DF localization systems, which can only track a single entity. In addition, Spot can estimate the number of entities correctly to within one difference error. This highlights that Spot achieves its goals of having an accurate and efficient software-only DF tracking solution of multiple entities in indoor environments.</data>

      <data key="title">lanequest an accurate and energy efficient lane detection system</data>
      <data key="abstract">Current outdoor localization techniques fail to provide the required accuracy for estimating the car's lane. In this paper, we present LaneQuest: a system that leverages the ubiquitous and low-energy inertial sensors available in commodity smart-phones to provide an accurate estimate of the car's current lane. LaneQuest leverages hints from the phone sensors about the surrounding environment to detect the car's lane. For example, a car making a right turn most probably will be in the right-most lane, a car passing by a pothole will be in a specific lane, and the car's angular velocity when driving through a curve reflects its lane. Our investigation shows that there are amble opportunities in the environment, i.e. lane “anchors”, that provide cues about the car's lane. To handle the ambiguous location, sensors noise, and fuzzy lane anchors; LaneQuest employs a novel probabilistic lane estimation algorithm. Furthermore, it uses an unsupervised crowd-sourcing approach to learn the position and lane-span distribution of the different lane-level anchors. Our evaluation results from implementation on different android devices and 260Km driving traces by 13 drivers in different cities shows that LaneQuest can detect the different lane-level anchors with an average precision and recall of more than 90%. This leads to an accurate detection of the exact car's lane position 80% of the time, increasing to 89% of the time to within one lane. This comes with a low-energy footprint, allowing LaneQuest to be implemented on the energy-constrained mobile devices.</data>

      <data key="title">aroma automatic generation of radio maps for localization systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">WLAN localization has become an active research field recently. Due to the wide WLAN deployment, WLAN localization provides ubiquitous coverage and adds to the value of the wireless network by providing the location of its users without using any additional hardware. However, WLAN localization systems usually require constructing a radio map, which is a major barrier of WLAN localization systems' deployment. The radio map stores information about the signal strength from different signal strength streams at selected locations in the site of interest. Typical construction of a radio map involves measurements and calibrations making it a tedious and time-consuming operation. In this paper, we present the AROMA system that automatically constructs accurate active and passive radio maps for both device-based and device-free WLAN localization systems. AROMA has three main goals: high accuracy, low computational requirements, and minimum user overhead. To achieve high accuracy, AROMA uses 3D ray tracing enhanced with the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) to model the electric field behavior and the human shadowing effect. AROMA also automates a number of routine tasks, such as importing building models and automatic sampling of the area of interest, to reduce the user's overhead. Finally, AROMA uses a number of optimization techniques to reduce the computational requirements. We present our system architecture and describe the details of its different components that allow AROMA to achieve its goals. We evaluate AROMA in two different testbeds. Our experiments show that the predicted signal strength differs from the measurements by a maximum average absolute error of 3.18 dBm achieving a maximum localization error of 2.44m for both the device-based and device-free cases.</data>

      <data key="title">a robust zero calibration rf based localization system for realistic environments</data>
      <data key="abstract">Due to the noisy indoor radio propagation channel, Radio Frequency (RF)-based location determination systems usually require a tedious calibration phase to construct an RF fingerprint of the area of interest. This fingerprint varies with the used mobile device, changes of the transmit power of smart access points (APs), and dynamic changes in the environment; requiring re-calibration of the area of interest; which reduces the technology ease of use. In this paper, we present IncVoronoi: a novel system that can provide zero-calibration accurate RF-based indoor localization that works in realistic environments. The basic idea is that the relative relation between the received signal strength from two APs at a certain location reflects the relative distance from this location to the respective APs. Building on this, IncVoronoi incrementally reduces the user ambiguity region based on refining the Voronoi tessellation of the area of interest. IncVoronoi also includes a number of modules to efficiently run in realtime as well as to handle practical deployment issues including the noisy wireless environment, obstacles in the environment, heterogeneous devices hardware, and smart APs. We have deployed IncVoronoi on different Android phones using the iBeacons technology in a university campus. Evaluation of IncVoronoi with a side-by-side comparison with traditional fingerprinting techniques shows that it can achieve a consistent median accuracy of 2.8m under different scenarios with a low beacon density of one beacon every 44m2. Compared to fingerprinting techniques, whose accuracy degrades by at least 156%, this accuracy comes with no training overhead and is robust to the different user devices, different transmit powers, and over temporal changes in the environment. This highlights the promise of IncVoronoi as a next generation indoor localization system.</data>

      <data key="abstract">One of the key technologies for future large-scale location-aware services covering a complex of multi-story buildings is a scalable indoor localization technique. In this paper, we report the current status of our investigation on the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for the scalable building/floor classification and floor-level position estimation based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting. Exploiting the hierarchical nature of the building/floor estimation and floor-level coordinates estimation of a location, we propose a new DNN architecture consisting of a stacked autoencoder for the reduction of feature space dimension and a feed-forward classifier for multi-label classification of building/floor/location, on which the multi-building and multi-floor indoor localization system based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting is built. We evaluate the performance of building/floor estimation and floor-level coordinates estimation of a given location using the UJIIndoorLoc dataset covering three buildings with four or five floors in the Jaume I University (UJI) campus, Spain. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DNN-based indoor localization system, which can provide near state-of-the-art performance using a single DNN. The proposed scalable DNN architecture for multi-building and multi-floor indoor localization based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting can achieve near state-of-the-art performance with just a single DNN and enables the implementation with lower complexity and energy consumption at mobile devices.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present WiGest: a system that leverages changes in WiFi signal strength to sense in-air hand gestures around the user's mobile device. Compared to related work, WiGest is unique in using standard WiFi equipment, with no modi-fications, and no training for gesture recognition. The system identifies different signal change primitives, from which we construct mutually independent gesture families. These families can be mapped to distinguishable application actions. We address various challenges including cleaning the noisy signals, gesture type and attributes detection, reducing false positives due to interfering humans, and adapting to changing signal polarity. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype using off-the-shelf laptops and extensively evaluate the system in both an office environment and a typical apartment with standard WiFi access points. Our results show that WiGest detects the basic primitives with an accuracy of 87.5% using a single AP only, including through-the-wall non-line-of-sight scenarios. This accuracy in-creases to 96% using three overheard APs. In addition, when evaluating the system using a multi-media player application, we achieve a classification accuracy of 96%. This accuracy is robust to the presence of other interfering humans, highlighting WiGest's ability to enable future ubiquitous hands-free gesture-based interaction with mobile devices.</data>

      <data key="title">fadewich fast deauthentication over the wireless channel</data>
      <data key="abstract">Both authentication and deauthentication are instrumental for preventing unauthorized access to computer and data assets. While there are obvious motivating factors for using strong authentication mechanisms, convincing users to deauthenticate is not straight-forward, since deauthentication is not considered mandatory. A user who leaves a logged-in workstation unattended (especially for a short time) is typically not inconvenienced in any way; in fact, the other way around: no annoying reauthentication is needed upon return. However, an unattended workstation is trivially susceptible to the well-known "lunchtime attack" by any nearby adversary who simply takes over the departed user's log-in session. At the same time, since deathentication does not intrinsically require user secrets, it can, in principle, be made unobtrusive. To this end, this paper designs the first automatic user deauthentication system, FADEWICH, that does not rely on biometric- or behavior-based techniques (e.g., keystroke dynamics) and does not require users to carry any devices. It uses physical properties of wireless signals and the effect of human bodies on their propagation. To assess FADEWICH's feasibility and performance, extensive experiments were conducted with its prototype. Results show that it suffices to have nine inexpensive wireless sensors deployed in a shared office setting to correctly deauthenticate all users within six seconds (90% within four seconds) after they leave their workstation's vicinity. We considered two realistic scenarios where the adversary attempts to subvert FADEWICH and showed that lunchtime attacks fail.</data>

      <data key="title">people sensing spatial characteristics of rf sensor networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">An “RF sensor” network can monitor RSS values on links in the network and perform device-free localization, i.e., locating a person or object moving in the area in which the network is deployed. This paper provides a statistical model for the RSS variance as a function of the person’s position w.r.t. the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). We show that the ensemble mean of the RSS variance has an approximately linear relationship with the expected total affected power (ETAP). We then use analysis to derive approximate expressions for the ETAP as a function of the person’s position, for both scattering and reflection. Counterintuitively, we show that reflection, not scattering, causes the RSS variance contours to be shaped like Cassini ovals. Experimental tests reported here and in past literature are shown to validate the analysis.</data>

      <data key="title">robust estimators for variance based device free localization and tracking</data>
      <data key="abstract">Human motion in the vicinity of a wireless link causes variations in the link received signal strength (RSS). Device-free localization (DFL) systems, such as variance-based radio tomographic imaging (VRTI), use these RSS variations in a static wireless network to detect, locate and track people in the area of the network, even through walls. However, intrinsic motion, such as branches moving in the wind and rotating or vibrating machinery, also causes RSS variations which degrade the performance of a DFL system. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two estimators to reduce the impact of the variations caused by intrinsic motion. One estimator uses subspace decomposition, and the other estimator uses a least squares formulation. Experimental results show that both estimators reduce localization root mean squared error by about 40% compared to VRTI. In addition, the Kalman filter tracking results from both estimators have 97% of errors less than 1.3 m, more than 60% improvement compared to tracking results from VRTI.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Monitoring breathing rates and patterns helps in the diagnosis and potential avoidance of various health problems. Current solutions for respiratory monitoring, however, are usually invasive and/or limited to medical facilities. In this paper, we propose a novel respiratory monitoring system, UbiBreathe, based on ubiquitous off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled devices. Our experiments show that the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a person's chest is affected by the breathing process. This effect extends to scenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the access point and the device, even without holding it. UbiBreathe leverages these changes in the WiFi RSS patterns to enable ubiquitous non-invasive respiratory rate estimation, as well as apnea detection. #R##N#We propose the full architecture and design for UbiBreathe, incorporating various modules that help reliably extract the hidden breathing signal from a noisy WiFi RSS. The system handles various challenges such as noise elimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting abnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using off-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it can estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute (bpm) error. In addition, UbiBreathe can detect apnea with more than 96% accuracy in both the device-on-chest and hands-free scenarios.

Evaluation of the system in two different testbeds shows that it can achieve an accurate detection capability in both environments with an F-measure of at least 0.93.

      <data key="abstract">With the fast growing demand of location-based services in indoor environments, indoor positioning based on fingerprinting has attracted a lot of interest due to its high accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning based indoor fingerprinting system using Channel State Information (CSI), which is termed DeepFi. Based on three hypotheses on CSI, the DeepFi system architecture includes an off-line training phase and an on-line localization phase. In the off-line training phase, deep learning is utilized to train all the weights of a deep network as fingerprints. Moreover, a greedy learning algorithm is used to train the weights layer-by-layer to reduce complexity. In the on-line localization phase, we use a probabilistic method based on the radial basis function to obtain the estimated location. Experimental results are presented to confirm that DeepFi can effectively reduce location error compared with three existing methods in two representative indoor environments.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we present Hapi, a novel system that uses off-the-shelf standard WiFi to provide pseudo-3D indoor localization---it estimates the user's floor and her 2D location on that floor. Hapi is calibration-free, only requiring the building's floorplans and its WiFi APs' installation location for deployment. Our analysis shows that while a user can hear APs from nearby floors as well as her floor, she will typically only receive signals from spatially closer APs in distant floors, as compared to APs in her floor. This is due to signal attenuation by floors/ceilings along with the 3D distance between the APs and the user. Hapi leverages this observation to achieve accurate and robust location estimates.   A deep-learning based method is proposed to identify the user's floor. Then, the identified floor along with the user's visible APs from all floors are used to estimate her 2D location through a novel RSS-Rank Gaussian-based method. Additionally, we present a regression based method to predict Hapi's location estimates' quality and employ it within a Kalman Filter to further refine the accuracy. Our evaluation results, from deployment on various android devices over 6 months with 13 subjects in 5 different up to 9 floors multistory buildings, show that Hapi can identify the user's exact floor up to 95.2% of the time and her 2D location with a median accuracy of 3.5m, achieving 52.1% and 76.0% improvement over related calibration-free state-of-the-art systems respectively.</data>

      <data key="title">nuzzer a large scale device free passive localization system for wireless environments</data>
      <data key="abstract">The widespread usage of wireless local area networks and mobile devices has fostered the interest in localization systems for wireless environments. The majority of research in the context of wireless-based localization systems has focused on device-based active localization, in which a device is attached to tracked entities. Recently, device-free passive localization (DfP) has been proposed where the tracked entity is neither required to carry devices nor participate actively in the localization process. DfP systems are based on the fact that RF signals are affected by the presence of people and objects in the environment. The DfP concept enables a wide range of applications including intrusion detection and tracking, border protection, and smart buildings automation. Previous studies have focused on small areas with direct line of sight and/or controlled environments. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and analysis of Nuzzer, a large-scale device-free passive localization system for real environments. #R##N#Without any additional hardware, it makes use of the already installed wireless data networks to monitor and process changes in the received signal strength (RSS) transmitted from access points at one or more monitoring points. We present probabilistic techniques for DfP localization and evaluate their performance in a typical office building, rich in multipath, with an area of 1500 square meters. Our results show that the Nuzzer system gives device-free location estimates with less than 2 meters median distance error using only two monitoring laptops and three access points. This indicates the suitability of Nuzzer to a large number of application domains.</data>

      <data key="abstract">RSS-based device-free localization (DFL) monitors changes in the received signal strength (RSS) measured by a network of static wireless nodes to locate people without requiring them to carry or wear any electronic device. Current models assume that the spatial impact area, i.e., the area in which a person affects a link's RSS, has constant size. This paper shows that the spatial impact area varies considerably for each link. Data from extensive experiments are used to derive a multi-scale spatial weight model that is a function of the fade level, i.e., the difference between the predicted and measured RSS, and of the direction of RSS change. In addition, a measurement model is proposed which gives a probability of a person locating inside the derived spatial model for each given RSS measurement. A real-time radio tomographic imaging system is described which uses channel diversity and the presented models. Experiments in an open indoor environment, in a typical one-bedroom apartment and in a through-wall scenario are conducted to determine the accuracy of the system. We demonstrate that the new system is capable of localizing and tracking a person with high accuracy (&lt;0.30 m) in all the environments, without the need to change the model parameters.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We develop novel methods for device-free localization (DFL) using transceivers in motion. Such localization technologies are useful in various cross-layer applications/protocols including those that are related to security situations where it is important to know the presence and position of an unauthorized person; in monitoring the daily activities of elderly or special needs individuals; or in emergency situations when police or firefighters can use the locations of people inside of a building in order to save lives. We propose that transceivers mounted on autonomous vehicles could be both quickly deployed and kept moving to ``sweep'' an area for changes in the channel that would indicate the location of moving people and objects. The challenge is that changes to channel measurements are introduced both by changes in the environment and from motion of the transceivers. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to detect human movement despite transceiver motion using ultra-wideband impulse radar (UWB-IR) transceivers. The measurements reliably detect a person's presence on a link line despite small-scale fading. We explore via multiple experiments the ability of mobile UWB-IR transceivers, moving outside of the walls of a room, to measure many lines crossing through the room and accurately locate a person inside within 0.25 m average error.</data>

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.</data>
