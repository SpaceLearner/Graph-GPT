      <data key="title">sat based methods for circuit synthesis</data>
      <data key="abstract">Reactive synthesis supports designers by automatically constructing correct hardware from declarative specifications. Synthesis algorithms usually compute a strategy, and then construct a circuit that implements it. In this work, we study SAT- and QBF-based methods for the second step, i.e., computing circuits from strategies. This includes methods based on QBF-certification, interpolation, and computational learning. We present optimizations, efficient implementations, and experimental results for synthesis from safety specifications, where we outperform BDDs both regarding execution time and circuit size. This is an extended version of [2], with an additional appendix.</data>

      <data key="title">strategy synthesis for multi dimensional quantitative objectives</data>
      <data key="abstract">Multi-dimensional mean-payoff and energy games provide the mathematical foundation for the quantitative study of reactive systems, and play a central role in the emerging quantitative theory of verification and synthesis. In this work, we study the strategy synthesis problem for games with such multi-dimensional objectives along with a parity condition, a canonical way to express $\omega$-regular conditions. While in general, the winning strategies in such games may require infinite memory, for synthesis the most relevant problem is the construction of a finite-memory winning strategy (if one exists). Our main contributions are as follows. First, we show a tight exponential bound (matching upper and lower bounds) on the memory required for finite-memory winning strategies in both multi-dimensional mean-payoff and energy games along with parity objectives. This significantly improves the triple exponential upper bound for multi energy games (without parity) that could be derived from results in literature for games on VASS (vector addition systems with states). Second, we present an optimal symbolic and incremental algorithm to compute a finite-memory winning strategy (if one exists) in such games. Finally, we give a complete characterization of when finite memory of strategies can be traded off for randomness. In particular, we show that for one-dimension mean-payoff parity games, randomized memoryless strategies are as powerful as their pure finite-memory counterparts.</data>

      <data key="title">a high level ltl synthesis format tlsf v1 1</data>
      <data key="abstract">We present the Temporal Logic Synthesis Format (TLSF), a high-level format to describe synthesis problems via Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The format builds upon standard LTL, but additionally allows to use high-level constructs, such as sets and functions, to provide a compact and human-readable representation. Furthermore, the format allows to identify parameters of a specification such that a single description can be used to define a family of problems. Additionally, we present a tool to automatically translate the format into plain LTL, which then can be used for synthesis by a solver. The tool also allows to adjust parameters of the specification and to apply standard transformations on the resulting formula.</data>

      <data key="title">towards realizability checking of contracts using theories</data>
      <data key="abstract">Virtual integration techniques focus on building architectural models of systems that can be analyzed early in the design cycle to try to lower cost, reduce risk, and improve quality of complex embedded systems. Given appropriate architectural descriptions and compositional reasoning rules, these techniques can be used to prove important safety properties about the architecture prior to system construction. Such proofs build from "leaf-level" assume/guarantee component contracts through architectural layers towards top-level safety properties. The proofs are built upon the premise that each leaf-level component contract is realizable; i.e., it is possible to construct a component such that for any input allowed by the contract assumptions, there is some output value that the component can produce that satisfies the contract guarantees. Without engineering support it is all too easy to write leaf-level components that can't be realized. Realizability checking for propositional contracts has been well-studied for many years, both for component synthesis and checking correctness of temporal logic requirements. However, checking realizability for contracts involving infinite theories is still an open problem. In this paper, we describe a new approach for checking realizability of contracts involving theories and demonstrate its usefulness on several examples.</data>

      <data key="title">developing a practical reactive synthesis tool experience and lessons learned</data>
      <data key="abstract">We summarise our experience developing and using Termite, the first reactive synthesis tool intended for use by software development practitioners. We identify the main barriers to making reactive synthesis accessible to software developers and describe the key features of Termite designed to overcome these barriers, including an imperative C-like specification language, an interactive source-level debugger, and a user-guided code generator. Based on our experience applying Termite to synthesising real-world reactive software, we identify several caveats of the practical use of the reactive synthesis technology. We hope that these findings will help define the agenda for future research on practical reactive synthesis.</data>

      <data key="title">interpolation based gr 1 assumptions refinement</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper considers the problem of assumptions refinement in the context of unrealizable specifications for reactive systems. We propose a new counterstrategy-guided synthesis approach for GR(1) specifications based on Craig's interpolants. Our interpolation-based method identifies causes for unrealizability and computes assumptions that directly target unrealizable cores, without the need for user input. Thereby, we discuss how this property reduces the maximum number of steps needed to converge to realizability compared with other techniques. We describe properties of interpolants that yield helpful assumptions in GR(1) and prove the soundness of the results. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach yields weaker assumptions than baseline techniques.</data>

      <data key="title">synthesizing a lego forklift controller in gr 1 a case study</data>
      <data key="abstract">Reactive synthesis is an automated procedure to obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system from a given specification. GR(1) is a well-known fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL) where synthesis is possible using a polynomial symbolic algorithm. We conducted a case study to learn about the challenges that software engineers may face when using GR(1) synthesis for the development of a reactive robotic system. In the case study we developed two variants of a forklift controller, deployed on a Lego robot. The case study employs LTL specification patterns as an extension of the GR(1) specification language, an examination of two specification variants for execution scheduling, traceability from the synthesized controller to constraints in the specification, and generated counter strategies to support understanding reasons for unrealizability. We present the specifications we developed, our observations, and challenges faced during the case study.</data>

      <data key="title">performance heuristics for gr 1 synthesis and related algorithms</data>
      <data key="abstract">Reactive synthesis for the GR(1) fragment of LTL has been implemented and studied in many works. In this workshop paper we present and evaluate a list of heuristics to potentially reduce running times for GR(1) synthesis and related algorithms. The list includes early detection of fixed-points and unrealizability, fixed-point recycling, and heuristics for unrealizable core computations. We evaluate the presented heuristics on SYNTECH15, a total of 78 specifications of 6 autonomous Lego robots, written by 3rd year undergraduate computer science students in a project class we have taught, as well as on several benchmarks from the literature. The evaluation investigates not only the potential of the suggested heuristics to improve computation times, but also the difference between existing benchmarks and the robot's specifications in terms of the effectiveness of the heuristics.</data>

      <data key="title">bosy an experimentation framework for bounded synthesis</data>
      <data key="abstract">We present BoSy, a reactive synthesis tool based on the bounded synthesis approach. Bounded synthesis ensures the minimality of the synthesized implementation by incrementally increasing a bound on the size of the solutions it considers. For each bound, the existence of a solution is encoded as a logical constraint solving problem that is solved by an appropriate solver. BoSy constructs bounded synthesis encodings into SAT, QBF, DQBF, EPR, and SMT, and interfaces to solvers of the corresponding type. When supported by the solver, BoSy extracts solutions as circuits, which can, if desired, be verified with standard hardware model checkers. BoSy won the LTL synthesis track at SYNTCOMP 2016. In addition to its use as a synthesis tool, BoSy can also be used as an experimentation and performance evaluation framework for various types of satisfiability solvers.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We study observation-based strategies for two-player turn-based games on#N#graphs with omega-regular objectives. An observation-based strategy relies on#N#imperfect information about the history of a play, namely, on the past sequence#N#of observations. Such games occur in the synthesis of a controller that does#N#not see the private state of the plant. Our main results are twofold. First, we#N#give a fixed-point algorithm for computing the set of states from which a#N#player can win with a deterministic observation-based strategy for any#N#omega-regular objective. The fixed point is computed in the lattice of#N#antichains of state sets. This algorithm has the advantages of being directed#N#by the objective and of avoiding an explicit subset construction on the game#N#graph. Second, we give an algorithm for computing the set of states from which#N#a player can win with probability 1 with a randomized observation-based#N#strategy for a Buechi objective.

We first survey previous such work for t he currently publicly available synthesis tools, and then draw conclusions by deriving useful schemes for future such evaluations. In particular, we explain why previous tools have incompatible scopes and semantics and provide a framework that reduces the impact of this problem for future experimental comparisons of such tools. Furthermore, we discuss which difficulties the compl ex workflows that begin to appear in modern synthesis tools induce on experimental evaluations and give answers to the question how convincing such evaluations can still be performed in such a setting.</data>

      <data key="title">validity guided synthesis of reactive systems from assume guarantee contracts</data>
      <data key="abstract">Automated synthesis of reactive systems from specifications has been a topic of research for decades. Recently, a variety of approaches have been proposed to extend synthesis of reactive systems from proposi- tional specifications towards specifications over rich theories. We propose a novel, completely automated approach to program synthesis which reduces the problem to deciding the validity of a set of forall-exists formulas. In spirit of IC3 / PDR, our problem space is recursively refined by blocking out regions of unsafe states, aiming to discover a fixpoint that describes safe reactions. If such a fixpoint is found, we construct a witness that is directly translated into an implementation. We implemented the algorithm on top of the JKind model checker, and exercised it against contracts written using the Lustre specification language. Experimental results show how the new algorithm outperforms JKinds already existing synthesis procedure based on k-induction and addresses soundness issues in the k-inductive approach with respect to unrealizable results.</data>

The solution space is given by a set of program transformations we consider in for repair process. These include reordering of instructions within a thread and inserting atomic sections. The new algorithm learns a constraint on the space of candidate solutions, from both positive examples (error-free traces) and counterexamples (error traces). From each counterexample, the algorithm learns a constraint necessary to remove the errors. From each positive examples, it learns a constraint that is necessary in order to prevent the repair from turning the trace into an error trace. We implemented the algorithm and evaluated it on simplified Linux device drivers with known bugs.</data>
