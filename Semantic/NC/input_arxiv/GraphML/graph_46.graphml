      <data key="title">filtered patent maps for predicting diversification paths of inventors and organizations</data>
      <data key="abstract">In a patent technology network map, almost all pairs of technology classes are connected, whereas most of the connections are extremely weak. This observation suggests the need and also the possibility to filter the network map by removing the negligible and noisy links. But link removal may reduce the power of the network for predicting the cross-field patent portfolio diversification of inventors and inventing organizations. This paper proposes a metric for such predictive power of a patent network, and a method that allows one to objectively choose a best tradeoff between predictive power and the removal of weak links. We show the results that identify filtered networks below the optimal tradeoff, and also remove a degree of arbitrariness compared with other filtering treatments from the literature. On that basis, we further demonstrate the use of filtered technology maps to visualize and analyze the main paths of patent portfolio diversification of a prolific inventor (Leonard Forbes) and a technology company (Google Inc.).</data>

      <data key="abstract">The use of Pearson's correlation coefficient in Author Cocitation Analysis was compared with Salton's cosine measure in a number of recent contributions. Unlike the Pearson correlation, the cosine is insensitive to the number of zeros. However, one has the option of applying a logarithmic transformation in correlation analysis. Information calculus is based on both the logarithmic transformation and provides a non-parametric statistics. Using this methodology one can cluster a document set in a precise way and express the differences in terms of bits of information. The algorithm is explained and used on the data set which was made the subject of this discussion.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Bibliometrics, "scientometrics", "informetrics", and "webometrics" can all be considered as manifestations of a single research area with similar objectives and methods, which we call "information metrics" or iMetrics. This study explores the cognitive and social distinctness of iMetrics with respect to the general information science (IS), focusing on a core of researchers, shared vocabulary and literature/knowledge base. Our analysis investigates the similarities and differences between four document sets. The document sets are drawn from three core journals for iMetrics research (Scientometrics, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, and Journal of Informetrics). We split JASIST into document sets containing iMetrics and general IS articles. The volume of publications in this representation of the specialty has increased rapidly during the last decade. A core of researchers that predominantly focus on iMetrics topics can thus be identified. This core group has developed a shared vocabulary as exhibited in high similarity of title words and one that shares a knowledge base. The research front of this field moves faster than the research front of information science in general, bringing it closer to Price's dream.</data>

      <data key="title">citation gaming induced by bibliometric evaluation a country level comparative analysis</data>
      <data key="abstract">It is several years since national research evaluation systems around the globe started making use of quantitative indicators to measure the performance of researchers. Nevertheless, the effects on these systems on the behavior of the evaluated researchers are still largely unknown. We attempt to shed light on this topic by investigating how Italian researchers reacted to the introduction in 2011 of national regulations in which key passages of professional careers are governed by bibliometric indicators. A new inwardness measure, able to gauge the degree of scientific self-referentiality of a country, is defined as the proportion of citations coming from the country itself compared to the total number of citations gathered by the country. Compared to the trends of the other G10 countries in the period 2000-2016, Italy's inwardness shows a net increase after the introduction of the new evaluation rules. Indeed, globally and also for a large majority of the research fields, Italy became the European country with the highest inwardness. Possible explanations are proposed and discussed, concluding that the observed trends are strongly suggestive of a generalized strategic use of citations, both in the form of author self-citations and of citation clubs. We argue that the Italian case offers crucial insights on the constitutive effects of evaluation systems. As such, it could become a paradigmatic case in the debate about the use of indicators in science-policy contexts.</data>

      <data key="title">toward alternative metrics of journal impact a comparison of download and citation data</data>
      <data key="abstract">We generated networks of journal relationships from citation and download data, and determined journal impact rankings from these networks using a set of social network centrality metrics. The resulting journal impact rankings were compared to the ISI IF. Results indicate that, although social network metrics and ISI IF rankings deviate moderately for citation-based journal networks, they differ considerably for journal networks derived from download data. We believe the results represent a unique aspect of general journal impact that is not captured by the ISI IF. These results furthermore raise questions regarding the validity of the ISI IF as the sole assessment of journal impact, and suggest the possibility of devising impact metrics based on usage information in general.</data>

      <data key="title">the semantic mapping of words and co words in contexts</data>
      <data key="abstract">Meaning can be generated when information is related at a systemic level. Such a system can be an observer, but also a discourse, for example, operationalized as a set of documents. The measurement of semantics as similarity in patterns (correlations) and latent variables (factor analysis) has been enhanced by computer techniques and the use of statistics; for example, in "Latent Semantic Analysis". This communication provides an introduction, an example, pointers to relevant software, and summarizes the choices that can be made by the analyst. Visualization ("semantic mapping") is thus made more accessible.</data>

      <data key="title">can scientific journals be classified in terms of aggregated journal journal citation relations using the journal citation reports</data>
      <data key="abstract">The aggregated citation relations among journals included in the Science Citation Index provide us with a huge matrix which can be analyzed in various ways. Using principal component analysis or factor analysis, the factor scores can be used as indicators of the position of the cited journals in the citing dimensions of the database. Unrotated factor scores are exact, and the extraction of principal components can be made stepwise since the principal components are independent. Rotation may be needed for the designation, but in the rotated solution a model is assumed. This assumption can be legitimated on pragmatic or theoretical grounds. Since the resulting outcomes remain sensitive to the assumptions in the model, an unambiguous classification is no longer possible in this case. However, the factor-analytic solutions allow us to test classifications against the structures contained in the database. This will be demonstrated for the delineation of a set of biochemistry journals.</data>

      <data key="title">advances in science visualization social networks semantic maps and discursive knowledge</data>
      <data key="abstract">Positional and relational perspectives on network data have led to two different research traditions in textual analysis and social network analysis, respectively. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) focuses on the latent dimensions in textual data; social network analysis (SNA) on the observable networks. The two coupled topographies of information-processing in the network space and meaning-processing in the vector space operate with different (nonlinear) dynamics. The historical dynamics of information processing in observable networks organizes the system into instantiations; the systems dynamics, however, can be considered as self-organizing in terms of fluxes of communication along the various dimensions that operate with different codes. The development over time adds evolutionary differentiation to the historical integration; a richer structure can process more complexity.</data>

      <data key="title">a principal component analysis of 39 scientific impact measures</data>
      <data key="abstract">Background: The impact of scientific publications has traditionally been expressed in terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. Methodology: We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.</data>

      <data key="title">measuring technological distance for patent mapping</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recent works in the information science literature have presented cases of using patent databases and patent classification information to construct network maps of technology fields, which aim to aid in competitive intelligence analysis and innovation decision making. Constructing such a patent network requires a proper measure of the distance between different classes of patents in the patent classification systems. Despite the existence of various distance measures in the literature, it is unclear how to consistently assess and compare them, and which ones to select for constructing patent technology network maps. This ambiguity has limited the development and applications of such technology maps. Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance measures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and similarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps. Using United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and the International Patent Classification IPC system, we compare 12 representative distance measures, which quantify interfield knowledge base proximity, field-crossing diversification likelihood or frequency of innovation agents, and co-occurrences of patent classes in the same patents. Our comparative analyses suggest the patent technology network maps based on normalized coreference and inventor diversification likelihood measures are the best representatives.</data>

Secondly, for each of the document event, linguistic units are extracted and combined into event networks. Thirdly, various analytic methods are proposed for event network analysis. In our application methodologies are presented for exploring open information.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Recommender systems provide personalized recommendations on products or services to user. The amount information handled by this type of systems is steadily growing. Furthermore, the development of recommendation systems is a difficult task due to the implementation of complex algorithms and metrics. For this reason, the success of recommendation systems depends on preliminary design decisions such as the most adequate similarity metric, the right process to infer proactive recommendations, for mentioning a few. This decision determines the process for generating recommendations and also impacts quality and user's satisfaction. In this paper, we propose RESYGEN, a Recommendation System Generator. RESYGEN allows the user to generate such kind of systems in an easy and friendly way. Furthermore, RESYGEN allows the generation of multi-domain systems such as music, video, books, travel, hardware, software, and food to mention a few. RESYGEN is based in the selection of the best distance metrics for nominal, ordinal, numeric and binary attributes, with the aim to reduce complexity for non-expert users and also to facilitate the selection of the metric which best fits to the data type. A system generated through RESYGEN has several interesting elements such as ratings, recommendations, cloud tag, among others. We performed a qualitative evaluation with the aim of comparing other recommender systems against systems generated by RESYGEN. The results shows that generated systems by RESYGEN, comprise the basic elements of a recommendation system.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The possibilities of using the Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI) for journal mapping have not been sufficiently recognized because of the absence of a Journal Citations Report (JCR) for this database. A quasi-JCR for the A&amp;HCI (2008) was constructed from the data contained in the Web-of-Science and is used for the evaluation of two journals as examples: Leonardo and Art Journal. The maps on the basis of the aggregated journal-journal citations within this domain can be compared with maps including references to journals in the Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index. Art journals are cited by (social) science journals more than by other art journals, but these journals draw upon one another in terms of their own references. This cultural impact in terms of being cited is not found when documents with a topic such as "digital humanities" are analyzed. This community of practice functions more as an intellectual organizer than a journal.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Aggregated journal-journal citation networks based on the Journal Citation Reports 2004 of the Science Citation Index (5968 journals) and the Social Science Citation Index (1712 journals) are made accessible from the perspective of any of these journals. The user is thus able to analyze the citation environment in terms of links and graphs. Furthermore, the local impact of a journal is defined as its share of the total citations in the specific journal's citation environments; the vertical size of the nodes is varied proportionally to this citation impact. The horizontal size of each node can be used to provide the same information after correction for within-journal (self)-citations. In the "citing" environment, the equivalents of this measure can be considered as a citation activity index which maps how the relevant journal environment is perceived by the collective of authors of a given journal. As a policy application, the mechanism of interdisciplinary developments among the sciences is elaborated for the case of nanotechnology journals.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Network maps of technology fields extracted from patent databases are useful to aid in technology forecasting and road mapping. Constructing such a network requires a measure of the relatedness between pairs of technology fields. Despite the existence of various relatedness measures in the literature, it is unclear how to consistently assess and compare them, and which ones to select for constructing technology network maps. This ambiguity has limited the use of technology network maps for technology forecasting and roadmap analyses. To address this challenge, here we propose a strategy to evaluate alternative relatedness measures and identify the superior ones by comparing the structure properties of resulting technology networks. Using United States patent data, we execute the strategy through a comparative analysis of twelve relatedness measures, which quantify inter-field knowledge input similarity, field-crossing diversification likelihood or frequency of innovation agents, and co-occurrences of technology classes in the same patents. Our comparative analyses suggest two superior relatedness measures, normalized co-reference and inventor diversification likelihood, for constructing technology network maps.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Co-occurrence matrices, such as co-citation, co-word, and co-link matrices, have been used widely in the information sciences. However, confusion and controversy have hindered the proper statistical analysis of this data. The underlying problem, in our opinion, involved understanding the nature of various types of matrices. This paper discusses the difference between a symmetrical co-citation matrix and an asymmetrical citation matrix as well as the appropriate statistical techniques that can be applied to each of these matrices, respectively. Similarity measures (like the Pearson correlation coefficient or the cosine) should not be applied to the symmetrical co-citation matrix, but can be applied to the asymmetrical citation matrix to derive the proximity matrix. The argument is illustrated with examples. The study then extends the application of co-occurrence matrices to the Web environment where the nature of the available data and thus data collection methods are different from those of traditional databases such as the Science Citation Index. A set of data collected with the Google Scholar search engine is analyzed using both the traditional methods of multivariate analysis and the new visualization software Pajek that is based on social network analysis and graph theory.</data>

      <data key="title">the import and export of cognitive science</data>
      <data key="abstract">From its inception, a large part of the motivation for Cognitive Science has been the need for an interdisciplinary journal for the study of minds and intelligent systems. One threat to the interdisciplinarity of Cognitive Science, both the field and journal, is that it may become, or already be, too dominated by psychologists. In 2005, psychology was a keyword for 51% of submissions, followed distantly by linguistics (17%), artificial intelligence (13%), neuroscience (10%), computer science (9%), and philosophy (8%). The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) gathers data not only on how individual articles cite one another, but also on macroscopic citation patterns among journals. Journals or sets of journals can be considered as proxies for fields. As fields become established, they often create journals. By studying the patterns of citations among journals that cite and are cited by Cognitive Science, we can better: 1) appreciate the scholarly ecology surrounding the journal and the journals role within this ecology, 2) establish competitor and alternate journals, and 3) determine the natural clustering of fields related to cognitive science.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Logarithmic transformation of the data has been recommended by the literature in the case of highly skewed distributions such as those commonly found in information science. The purpose of the transformation is to make the data conform to the lognormal law of error for inferential purposes. How does this transformation affect the analysis? We factor analyze and visualize the citation environment of the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) before and after a logarithmic transformation. The transformation strongly reduces the variance necessary for classificatory purposes and therefore is counterproductive to the purposes of the descriptive statistics. We recommend against the logarithmic transformation when sets cannot be defined unambiguously. The intellectual organization of the sciences is reflected in the curvilinear parts of the citation distributions, while negative powerlaws fit excellently to the tails of the distributions.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Co-words have been considered as carriers of meaning across different domains in studies of science, technology, and society. Words and co-words, however, obtain meaning in sentences, and sentences obtain meaning in their contexts of use. At the science/society interface, words can be expected to have different meanings: the codes of communication that provide meaning to words differ on the varying sides of the interface. Furthermore, meanings and interfaces may change over time. Given this structuring of meaning across interfaces and over time, we distinguish between metaphors and diaphors as reflexive mechanisms that facilitate the translation between contexts. Our empirical focus is on three recent scientific controversies: Monarch butterflies, Frankenfoods, and stem-cell therapies. This study explores new avenues that relate the study of co-word analysis in context with the sociological quest for the analysis and processing of meaning.</data>
