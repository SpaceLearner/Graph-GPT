      <data key="title">physical layer security of a buffer aided full duplex relaying system</data>
      <data key="abstract">This letter proposes a novel hybrid half-/full-duplex relaying scheme to enhance the relay channel security. A source node (Alice) communicates with her destination node (Bob) in the presence of a buffer-aided full-duplex relay node (Rooney) and a potential eavesdropper (Eve). Rooney adopts two different relaying strategies, namely randomize-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying strategies, to improve the security of the legitimate system. In the first relaying strategy, Rooney uses a codebook different from that used at Alice. In the second relaying strategy, Rooney and Alice use the same codebooks. In addition, Rooney switches between half-duplex and full-duplex modes to further enhance the security of the legitimate system. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves a significant average secrecy end-to-end throughput improvement relative to the conventional bufferless full-duplex relaying scheme.</data>

      <data key="title">cooperative jamming for wireless physical layer security</data>
      <data key="abstract">Cooperative jamming is an approach that has been recently proposed for improving physical layer based security for wireless networks in the presence of an eavesdropper. While the source transmits its message to its destination, a relay node transmits a jamming signal to create interference at the eavesdropper. In this paper, a scenario in which the relay is equipped with multiple antennas is considered. A novel system design is proposed for determining the antenna weights and transmit power of source and relay, so that the system secrecy rate is maximized subject to a total transmit power constraint, or, the transmit power is minimized subject to a secrecy rate constraint. Since the optimal solutions to these problems are difficult to obtain, suboptimal closed-form solutions are proposed that introduce an additional constraint, i.e., the complete nulling of jamming signal at the destination.</data>

      <data key="title">energy efficient secrecy in wireless networks based on random jamming</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper considers secure energy-efficient routing in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. Previous work in this area has considered secure routing assuming probabilistic or exact knowledge of the location and channel-state-information (CSI) of each eavesdropper. In wireless networks, however, the locations and CSIs of passive eavesdroppers are not known, making it challenging to guarantee secrecy for any routing algorithm. We develop an efficient (in terms of energy consumption and computational complexity) routing algorithm that does not rely on any information about the locations and CSIs of the eavesdroppers. Our algorithm guarantees secrecy even in disadvantaged wireless environments, where multiple eavesdroppers try to eavesdrop each message, are equipped with directional antennas, or can get arbitrarily close to the transmitter. The key is to employ additive random jamming to exploit inherent non-idealities of the eavesdropper’s receiver, which makes the eavesdroppers incapable of recording the messages. We have simulated our proposed algorithm and compared it with the existing secrecy routing algorithms in both single-hop and multi-hop networks. Our results indicate that when the uncertainty in the locations of eavesdroppers is high and/or in disadvantaged wireless environments, our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of energy consumption and secrecy.</data>

      <data key="title">energy efficient routing in wireless networks in the presence of jamming</data>
      <data key="abstract">The effectiveness and the simple implementation of physical layer jammers make them an essential threat for wireless networks. In a multihop wireless network, where jammers can interfere with the transmission of user messages at intermediate nodes along the path, one can employ jamming oblivious routing and then employ physical-layer techniques (e.g., spread spectrum) to suppress jamming. However, whereas these approaches can provide significant gains, the residual jamming can still severely limit system performance. This motivates the consideration of routing approaches that account for the differences in the jamming environment between different paths. First, we take a straightforward approach where an equal outage probability is allocated to each link along a path and develop a minimum energy routing solution. Next, we demonstrate the shortcomings of this approach and then consider the joint problem of outage allocation and routing by employing an approximation to the link outage probability. This yields an efficient and effective routing algorithm that only requires knowledge of the measured jamming at each node. Numerical results demonstrate that the amount of energy saved by the proposed methods with respect to a standard minimum energy routing algorithm, especially for parameters appropriate for terrestrial wireless networks, is substantial.</data>

      <data key="title">jamming based on an ephemeral key to obtain everlasting security in wireless environments</data>
      <data key="abstract">Secure communication over a wiretap channel is considered in the disadvantaged wireless environment, where the eavesdropper channel is (possibly much) better than the main channel. We present a method to exploit inherent vulnerabilities of the eavesdroppers receiver to obtain everlasting secrecy. Based on an ephemeral cryptographic key pre-shared between the transmitter Alice and the intended recipient Bob, a random jamming signal is added to each symbol. Bob can subtract the jamming signal before recording the signal, while the eavesdropper Eve is forced to perform these non-commutative operations in the opposite order. Thus, information-theoretic secrecy can be obtained, hence achieving the goal of converting the vulnerable “cheap” cryptographic secret key bits into “valuable” information-theoretic (i.e., everlasting) secure bits. We evaluate the achievable secrecy rates for different settings, and show that, even when the eavesdropper has perfect access to the output of the transmitter (albeit through an imperfect analog-to-digital converter), the method can still achieve a positive secrecy rate. Next we consider a wideband system, where Alice and Bob perform frequency hopping in addition to adding the random jamming to the signal, and we show the utility of such an approach even in the face of substantial eavesdropper hardware capabilities.</data>

      <data key="title">relay placement for physical layer security a secure connection perspective</data>
      <data key="abstract">This work studies the problem of secure connection in cooperative wireless communication with two relay strategies, decode-and-forward (DF) and randomize-and-forward (RF). The four-node scenario and cellular scenario are considered. For the typical four-node (source, destination, relay, and eavesdropper) scenario, we derive the optimal power allocation for the DF strategy and find that the RF strategy is always better than the DF to enhance secure connection. In cellular networks, we show that without relay, it is difficult to establish secure connections from the base station to the cell edge users. The effect of relay placement for the cell edge users is demonstrated by simulation. For both scenarios, we find that the benefit of relay transmission increases when path loss becomes severer.</data>

      <data key="title">the secrecy graph and some of its properties</data>
      <data key="abstract">A new random geometric graph model, the so-called secrecy graph, is introduced and studied. The graph represents a wireless network and includes only edges over which secure communication in the presence of eavesdroppers is possible. The underlying point process models considered are lattices and Poisson point processes. In the lattice case, analogies to standard bond and site percolation can be exploited to determine percolation thresholds. In the Poisson case, the node degrees are determined and percolation is studied using analytical bounds and simulations. It turns out that a small density of eavesdroppers already has a drastic impact on the connectivity of the secrecy graph.</data>

      <data key="title">scaling laws for secrecy capacity in cooperative wireless networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">We investigate large wireless networks subject to security constraints. In contrast to point-to-point, interference-limited communications considered in prior works, we propose active cooperative relaying based schemes. We consider a network with $n_l$ legitimate nodes, $n_e$ eavesdroppers, and path loss exponent $\alpha\geq 2$. As long as $n_e^2(\log(n_e))^{\gamma}=o(n_l)$, for some positive $\gamma$, we show one can obtain unbounded secure aggregate rate. This means zero-cost secure communication, given fixed total power constraint for the entire network. We achieve this result through (i) the source using Wyner randomized encoder and a serial (multi-stage) block Markov scheme, to cooperate with the relays and (ii) the relays acting as a virtual multi-antenna to apply beamforming against the eavesdroppers. Our simpler parallel (two-stage) relaying scheme can achieve the same unbounded secure aggregate rate when $n_e^{\frac{\alpha}{2}+1}(\log(n_e))^{\gamma+\delta(\frac{\alpha}{2}+1)}=o(n_l)$ holds, for some positive $\gamma,\delta$.</data>

      <data key="title">optimal energy and data routing in networks with energy cooperation</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider the delay minimization problem in an energy harvesting communication network with energy cooperation. In this network, nodes harvest energy from nature to sustain the power needed for data transmission, and may transfer a portion of their harvested energies to neighboring nodes through energy cooperation. For fixed data and energy routing topologies, we determine the optimum data rates, transmit powers, and energy transfers, subject to flow and energy conservation constraints, to minimize the network delay. We start with a simplified problem where data flows are fixed and optimize energy management at each node for the case of a single energy harvest per node. This is tantamount to distributing each node’s available energy over its outgoing data links and energy transfers to neighboring nodes. For this case, with no energy cooperation, we show that each node should allocate more power to links with more noise and/or more data flow. In addition, when there is energy cooperation, our numerical results indicate that the energy is routed from nodes with lower data loads to nodes with higher data loads. We then extend this setting to the case of multiple energy harvests per node over time. In this case, we optimize each node’s energy management over its outgoing data links and its energy transfers to neighboring nodes, over multiple time slots. For this case, with no energy cooperation, we show that, for any given node, the sum of powers on the outgoing links over time is equal to the single-link optimal power over time. Finally, we consider the problem of joint flow control and energy management for the entire network. We determine the necessary conditions for joint optimality of a power control, energy transfer, and routing policy. We provide an iterative algorithm that updates the data flows, energy flows, and power distribution over outgoing data links sequentially. We show that this algorithm converges to a Pareto-optimal operating point.</data>

      <data key="title">optimal relay selection for physical layer security in cooperative wireless networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we explore the physical-layer security in cooperative wireless networks with multiple relays where both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols are considered. We propose the AF and DF based optimal relay selection (i.e., AFbORS and DFbORS) schemes to improve the wireless security against eavesdropping attack. For the purpose of comparison, we examine the traditional AFbORS and DFbORS schemes, denoted by T-AFbORS and T-DFbORS, respectively. We also investigate a so-called multiple relay combining (MRC) framework and present the traditional AF and DF based MRC schemes, called T-AFbMRC and T-DFbMRC, where multiple relays participate in forwarding the source signal to destination which then combines its received signals from the multiple relays. We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions of the proposed AFbORS and DFbORS (i.e., P-AFbORS and P-DFbORS) as well as the T-AFbORS, T-DFbORS, T-AFbMRC and T-DFbMRC schemes in the presence of eavesdropping attack. We further conduct an asymptotic intercept probability analysis to evaluate the diversity order performance of relay selection schemes and show that no matter which relaying protocol is considered (i.e., AF and DF), the traditional and proposed optimal relay selection approaches both achieve the diversity order M where M represents the number of relays. In addition, numerical results show that for both AF and DF protocols, the intercept probability performance of proposed optimal relay selection is strictly better than that of the traditional relay selection and multiple relay combining methods.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we study the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, where each user applies power splitting scheme to coordinate the energy harvesting and secrecy information decoding processes. Assuming equal power allocation across subcarriers, we formulate the problem to maximize the aggregate harvested power of all users while satisfying secrecy rate requirement of individual user by joint subcarrier allocation and optimal power splitting ratio selection. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose two suboptimal algorithms to solve the problem in the dual domain. The first one is an iterative algorithm that optimizes subcarrier allocation and power splitting in an alternating way. The second algorithm is based on a two-step approach that solves the subcarrier allocation and power splitting sequentially. The numerical results show that the proposed methods outperform conventional methods. It is also shown that the iterative algorithm performs close to the upper bound and the step-wise algorithm provides good tradeoffs between performance and complexity.</data>

      <data key="title">efficient wireless security through jamming coding and routing</data>
      <data key="abstract">There is a rich recent literature on how to assist secure communication between a single transmitter and receiver at the physical layer of wireless networks through techniques such as cooperative jamming. In this paper, we consider how these single-hop physical layer security techniques can be extended to multi-hop wireless networks and show how to augment physical layer security techniques with higher layer network mechanisms such as coding and routing. Specifically, we consider the secure minimum energy routing problem, in which the objective is to compute a minimum energy path between two network nodes subject to constraints on the end-to-end communication secrecy and goodput over the path. This problem is formulated as a constrained optimization of transmission power and link selection, which is proved to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, we show that efficient algorithms exist to compute both exact and approximate solutions for the problem. In particular, we develop an exact solution of pseudo-polynomial complexity, as well as an epsilon-optimal approximation of polynomial complexity. Simulation results are also provided to show the utility of our algorithms and quantify their energy savings compared to a combination of (standard) security-agnostic minimum energy routing and physical layer security. In the simulated scenarios, we observe that, by jointly optimizing link selection at the network layer and cooperative jamming at the physical layer, our algorithms reduce the network energy consumption by half.</data>

      <data key="title">on secrecy capacity scaling in wireless networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">This work studies the achievable secure rate per source-destination pair in wireless networks. First, a path loss model is considered, where the legitimate and eavesdropper nodes are assumed to be placed according to Poisson point processes with intensities $\lambda$ and $\lambda_e$, respectively. It is shown that, as long as $\lambda_e/\lambda=o((\log n)^{-2})$, almost all of the nodes achieve a perfectly secure rate of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ for the extended and dense network models. Therefore, under these assumptions, securing the network does not entail a loss in the per-node throughput. The achievability argument is based on a novel multi-hop forwarding scheme where randomization is added in every hop to ensure maximal ambiguity at the eavesdropper(s). Secondly, an ergodic fading model with $n$ source-destination pairs and $n_e$ eavesdroppers is considered. Employing the ergodic interference alignment scheme with an appropriate secrecy pre-coding, each user is shown to achieve a constant positive secret rate for sufficiently large $n$. Remarkably, the scheme does not require eavesdropper CSI (only the statistical knowledge is assumed) and the secure throughput per node increases as we add more legitimate users to the network in this setting. Finally, the effect of eavesdropper collusion on the performance of the proposed schemes is characterized.</data>

      <data key="title">secure degrees of freedom of one hop wireless networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">We study the secure degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of one-hop wireless networks by considering four fundamental wireless network structures: 1) Gaussian wiretap channel; 2) Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages; 3) Gaussian interference channel with confidential messages; and 4) Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel. The secrecy capacity of the canonical Gaussian wiretap channel does not scale with the transmit power, and hence, the secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero. It has been known that a strictly positive secure d.o.f. can be obtained in the Gaussian wiretap channel by using a helper, which sends structured cooperative signals. We show that the exact secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper is    ${{1}\over{2}}$   . Our achievable scheme is based on real interference alignment and cooperative jamming, which renders the message signal and the cooperative jamming signal separable at the legitimate receiver, but aligns them perfectly at the eavesdropper preventing any reliable decoding of the message signal. Our converse is based on two key lemmas. The first lemma quantifies the secrecy penalty by showing that the net effect of an eavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel inputs. The second lemma quantifies the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. We extend this result to the case of    $M$    helpers, and show that the exact secure d.o.f. in this case is    ${{M}\over{M+1}}$   . We then generalize this approach to more general network structures with multiple messages. We show that the sum secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages and    $M$    helpers is 1, the sum secure d.o.f. of the two-user interference channel with confidential messages is    ${{2}\over{3}}$   , the sum secure d.o.f. of the two-user interference channel with confidential messages and    $M$    helpers is 1, and the sum secure d.o.f. of the    $K$   -user multiple access wiretap channel is    ${{K(K-1)}\over{K(K-1)+1}}$   .</data>

      <data key="title">when does relay transmission give a more secure connection in wireless ad hoc networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Relay transmission can enhance coverage and throughput, whereas it can be vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to the additional transmission of the source message at the relay. Thus, whether or not one should use relay transmission for secure communication is an interesting and important problem. In this paper, we consider the transmission of a confidential message from a source to a destination in a decentralized wireless network in the presence of randomly distributed eavesdroppers. The source-destination pair can be potentially assisted by randomly distributed relays. For an arbitrary relay, we derive exact expressions of secure connection probability for both colluding and noncolluding eavesdroppers. We further obtain lower bound expressions on the secure connection probability, which are accurate when the eavesdropper density is small. Using these lower bound expressions, we propose a relay selection strategy to improve the secure connection probability. By analytically comparing the secure connection probability for direct transmission and relay transmission, we address the important problem of whether or not to relay and discuss the condition for relay transmission in terms of the relay density and source-destination distance. These analytical results are accurate in the small eavesdropper density regime.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we study the problem of secure routing in a multihop wireless ad-hoc network in the presence of randomly distributed eavesdroppers. Specifically, the locations of the eavesdroppers are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) and the source-destination pair is assisted by intermediate relays using the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. We analytically characterize the physical layer security performance of any chosen multihop path using the end-to-end secure connection probability (SCP) for both colluding and noncolluding eavesdroppers. To facilitate finding an efficient solution to secure routing, we derive accurate approximations of the SCP. Based on the SCP approximations, we study the secure routing problem, which is defined as finding the multihop path having the highest SCP. A revised Bellman–Ford algorithm is adopted to find the optimal path in a distributed manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed secure routing scheme achieves nearly the same performance as exhaustive search.</data>

      <data key="title">multi hop routing in covert wireless networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In covert communication, Alice tries to communicate with Bob without being detected by a warden Willie. When the distance between Alice and Bob becomes large compared to the distance between Alice and Willie(s), the performance of covert communication will be degraded. In this case, multi-hop message transmission via intermediate relays can help to improve performance. Hence, in this work multi-hop covert communication over a moderate size network and in the presence of multiple collaborating Willies is considered. The relays can transmit covertly using either a single key for all relays, or different independent keys at the relays. For each case, we develop efficient algorithms to find optimal paths with maximum throughput and minimum end-to-end delay between Alice and Bob. As expected, employing multiple hops significantly improves the ability to communicate covertly versus the case of a single-hop transmission. Furthermore, at the expense of more shared key bits, analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that multi-hop covert communication with different independent keys at the relays has better performance than multi-hop covert communication with a single key.</data>

The IRs are served with best-effort secrecy data and the ERs harvest energy with minimum required harvested power. To enhance the physical layer security for IRs and yet satisfy energy harvesting requirements for ERs, we propose a new frequency-domain artificial noise (AN) aided transmission strategy. With the new strategy, we study the optimal resource allocation for the weighted sum secrecy rate maximization for IRs by power and subcarrier allocation at the transmitter. The studied problem is shown to be a mixed integer programming problem and thus nonconvex, while we propose an efficient algorithm for solving it based on the Lagrange duality method. To further reduce the computational complexity, we also propose a suboptimal algorithm of lower complexity.
