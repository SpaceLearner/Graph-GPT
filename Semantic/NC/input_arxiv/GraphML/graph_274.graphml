      <data key="title">catching fire via likes inferring topic preferences of trump followers on twitter</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we propose a framework to infer the topic preferences of Donald Trump's followers on Twitter. We first use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to derive the weighted mixture of topics for each Trump tweet. Then we use negative binomial regression to model the "likes," with the weights of each topic serving as explanatory variables. Our study shows that attacking Democrats such as President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earns Trump the most "likes." Our framework of inference is generalizable to the study of other politicians.</data>

      <data key="title">a hybrid model for role related user classification on twitter</data>
      <data key="abstract">To aid a variety of research studies, we propose TWIROLE, a hybrid model for role-related user classification on Twitter, which detects male-related, female-related, and brand-related (i.e., organization or institution) users. TWIROLE leverages features from tweet contents, user profiles, and profile images, and then applies our hybrid model to identify a user's role. To evaluate it, we used two existing large datasets about Twitter users, and conducted both intra- and inter-comparison experiments. TWIROLE outperforms existing methods and obtains more balanced results over the several roles. We also confirm that user names and profile images are good indicators for this task. Our research extends prior work that does not consider brand-related users, and is an aid to future evaluation efforts relative to investigations that rely upon self-labeled datasets.</data>

      <data key="title">voting with feet who are leaving hillary clinton and donald trump</data>
      <data key="abstract">From a crowded field with 17 candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have emerged as the two front-runners in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The two candidates each boast more than 5 million followers on Twitter, and at the same time both have witnessed hundreds of thousands of people leave their camps. In this paper we attempt to characterize individuals who have left Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump between September 2015 and March 2016. #R##N#Our study focuses on three dimensions of social demographics: social capital, gender, and age. Within each camp, we compare the characteristics of the current followers with former followers, i.e., individuals who have left since September 2015. We use the number of followers to measure social capital, and profile images to infer gender and age. For classifying gender, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN). For age, we use the Face++ API. #R##N#Our study shows that for both candidates followers with more social capital are more likely to leave (or switch camps). For both candidates females make up a larger presence among unfollowers than among current followers. Somewhat surprisingly, the effect is particularly pronounced for Clinton. Lastly, middle-aged individuals are more likely to leave Trump, and the young are more likely to leave Hillary Clinton.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we present quantitative and qualitative analysis of the top retweeted tweets (viral tweets) pertaining to the US presidential elections from September 1, 2016 to Election Day on November 8, 2016. For everyday, we tagged the top 50 most retweeted tweets as supporting or attacking either candidate or as neutral/irrelevant. Then we analyzed the tweets in each class for: general trends and statistics; the most frequently used hashtags, terms, and locations; the most retweeted accounts and tweets; and the most shared news and links. In all we analyzed the 3,450 most viral tweets that grabbed the most attention during the US election and were retweeted in total 26.3 million times accounting over 40% of the total tweet volume pertaining to the US election in the aforementioned period. Our analysis of the tweets highlights some of the differences between the social media strategies of both candidates, the penetration of their messages, and the potential effect of attacks on both</data>

      <data key="title">who falls for online political manipulation</data>
      <data key="abstract">Social media, once hailed as a vehicle for democratization and the promotion of positive social change across the globe, are under attack for becoming a tool of political manipulation and spread of disinformation. A case in point is the alleged use of trolls by Russia to spread malicious content in Western elections. This paper examines the Russian interference campaign in the 2016 US presidential election on Twitter. Our aim is twofold: first, we test whether predicting users who spread trolls' content is feasible in order to gain insight on how to contain their influence in the future; second, we identify features that are most predictive of users who either intentionally or unintentionally play a vital role in spreading this malicious content. We collected a dataset with over 43 million elections-related posts shared on Twitter between September 16 and November 9, 2016, by about 5.7 million users. This dataset includes accounts associated with the Russian trolls identified by the US Congress. Proposed models are able to very accurately identify users who spread the trolls' content (average AUC score of 96%, using 10-fold validation). We show that political ideology, bot likelihood scores, and some activity-related account meta data are the most predictive features of whether a user spreads trolls' content or not.</data>

      <data key="title">catching up with trends the changing landscape of political discussions on twitter in 2014 and 2019</data>
      <data key="abstract">The advent of 4G increased the usage of internet in India, which took a huge number of discussions online. Online Social Networks (OSNs) are the center of these discussions. During elections, political discussions constitute a significant portion of the trending topics on these networks. Politicians and political parties catch up with these trends, and social media then becomes a part of their publicity agenda. We cannot ignore this trend in any election, be it the U.S, Germany, France, or India. Twitter is a major platform where we observe these trends. In this work, we examine the magnitude of political discussions on twitter by contrasting the platform usage on levels like gender, political party, and geography, in 2014 and 2019 Indian General Elections. In a further attempt to understand the strategies followed by political parties, we compare twitter usage by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress (INC) in 2019 General Elections in terms of how efficiently they make use of the platform. We specifically analyze the handles of politicians who emerged victorious. We then proceed to compare political handles held by frontmen of BJP and INC: Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) and Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) using parameters like "following", "tweeting habits", "sources used to tweet", along with text analysis of tweets. With this work, we also introduce a rich dataset covering a majority of tweets made during the election period in 2014 and 2019.</data>

      <data key="title">social politics agenda setting and political communication on social media</data>
      <data key="abstract">Social media play an increasingly important role in political communication. Various studies investigated how individuals adopt social media for political discussion, to share their views about politics and policy, or to mobilize and protest against social issues. Yet, little attention has been devoted to the main actors of political discussions: the politicians. In this paper, we explore the topics of discussion of U.S. President Obama and the 50 U.S. State Governors using Twitter data and agenda-setting theory as a tool to describe the patterns of daily political discussion, uncovering the main topics of attention and interest of these actors. We examine over one hundred thousand tweets produced by these politicians and identify seven macro-topics of conversation, finding that Twitter represents a particularly appealing vehicle of conversation for American opposition politicians. We highlight the main motifs of political conversation of the two parties, discovering that Republican and Democrat Governors are more or less similarly active on Twitter but exhibit different styles of communication. Finally, by reconstructing the networks of occurrences of Governorsâ€™ hashtags and keywords related to political issues, we observe that Republicans and Democrats form two tight yet polarized cores, with a strongly different shared agenda on many issues of discussion.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Measuring and forecasting opinion trends from real-time social media is a long-standing goal of big-data analytics. Despite the large amount of work addressing this question, there has been no clear validation of online social media opinion trend with traditional surveys. Here we develop a method to infer the opinion of Twitter users by using a combination of statistical physics of complex networks and machine learning based on hashtags co-occurrence to build an in-domain training set of the order of a million tweets. We validate our method in the context of 2016 US Presidential Election by comparing the Twitter opinion trend with the New York Times National Polling Average, representing an aggregate of hundreds of independent traditional polls. The Twitter opinion trend follows the aggregated NYT polls with remarkable accuracy. We investigate the dynamics of the social network formed by the interactions among millions of Twitter supporters and infer the support of each user to the presidential candidates. Our analytics unleash the power of Twitter to uncover social trends from elections, brands to political movements, and at a fraction of the cost of traditional surveys.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we study follower demographics of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the two leading candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. We build a unique dataset US2016, which includes the number of followers for each candidate from September 17, 2015 to December 22, 2015. US2016 also includes the geographical location of these followers, the number of their own followers and, very importantly, the profile image of each follower. We use individuals' number of followers and profile images to analyze four dimensions of follower demographics: social status, gender, race and age. Our study shows that in terms of social influence, the Trumpists are more polarized than the Clintonists: they tend to have either a lot of influence or little influence. We also find that compared with the Clintonists, the Trumpists are more likely to be either very young or very old. Our study finds no gender affinity effect for Clinton in the Twitter sphere, but we do find that the Clintonists are more racially diverse.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Forecasting opinion trends from real-time social media is the long-standing goal of modern-day big-data analytics. Despite its importance, there has been no conclusive scientific evidence so far that social media activity can capture the opinion of the general population at large. Here we develop analytic tools combining statistical physics of complex networks, percolation theory, natural language processing and machine learning classification to infer the opinion of Twitter users regarding the candidates of the 2016 US Presidential Election. Using a large-scale dataset of 73 million tweets collected from June 1st to September 1st 2016, we investigate the temporal social networks formed by the interactions among millions of Twitter users. We infer the support of each user to the presidential candidates and show that the resulting Twitter trends follow the New York Times National Polling Average, which represents an aggregate of hundreds of independent traditional polls, with remarkable accuracy (r=0.9). More importantly, the Twitter opinion trend forecasts the aggregated NYT polls by 6 to 15 days, showing that Twitter can be an early warning signal of global opinion trends at the national level.

      <data key="abstract">When information flow fails, when Democrats and Republicans do not talk to each other, when Israelis and Palestinians do not talk to each other, and when North Koreans and South Koreans do not talk to each other, mis-perceptions, biases and fake news arise. In this paper we present an in-depth study of political polarization and social division using Twitter data and Monte Carlo simulations. First, we study at the aggregate level people's inclination to retweet within their own ideological circle. Introducing the concept of cocoon ratio, we show that Donald Trump's followers are 2.56 more likely to retweet a fellow Trump follower than to retweet a Hillary Clinton follower. Second, going down to the individual level, we show that the tendency of retweeting exclusively within one's ideological circle is stronger for women than for men and that such tendency weakens as one's social capital grows. Third, we use a one-dimensional Ising model to simulate how a society with high cocoon ratios could end up becoming completely divided. We conclude with a discussion of our findings with respect to fake news.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The 2016 U.S. presidential election has witnessed the major role of Twitter in the year's most important political event. Candidates used this social media platform extensively for online campaigns. Meanwhile, social media has been filled with rumors, which might have had huge impacts on voters' decisions. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of rumor tweets from the followers of two presidential candidates: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. To overcome the difficulty of labeling a large amount of tweets as training data, we detect rumor tweets by matching them with verified rumor articles. We analyze over 8 million tweets collected from the followers of the two candidates. Our results provide answers to several primary concerns about rumors in this election, including: which side of the followers posted the most rumors, who posted these rumors, what rumors they posted, and when they posted these rumors. The insights of this paper can help us understand the online rumor behaviors in American politics.</data>

      <data key="title">how polarized have we become a multimodal classification of trump followers and clinton followers</data>
      <data key="abstract">Polarization in American politics has been extensively documented and analyzed for decades, and the phenomenon became all the more apparent during the 2016 presidential election, where Trump and Clinton depicted two radically different pictures of America. Inspired by this gaping polarization and the extensive utilization of Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign, in this paper we take the first step in measuring polarization in social media and we attempt to predict individualsâ€™ Twitter following behavior through analyzing onesâ€™ everyday tweets, profile images and posted pictures. As such, we treat polarization as a classification problem and study to what extent Trump followers and Clinton followers on Twitter can be distinguished, which in turn serves as a metric of polarization in general. We apply LSTM to processing tweet features and we extract visual features using the VGG neural network. Integrating these two sets of features boosts the overall performance. We are able to achieve an accuracy of 69%, suggesting that the high degree of polarization recorded in the literature has started to manifest itself in social media as well.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 87.6% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error by more than 6%.

First, we propose a novel way of obtaining large numbers of facial images with nationality labels. Then we train state-of-the-art neural networks with these labeled images. We are able to achieve an accuracy of 75.03% in the classification task, with chances being 33.33% and human accuracy 38.89% . Further, we train multiple facial attribute classifiers to identify the most distinctive features for each group. We find that Chinese, Japanese and Koreans do exhibit substantial differences in certain attributes, such as bangs, smiling, and bushy eyebrows. Along the way, we uncover several gender-related cross-country patterns as well. Our work, which complements existing APIs such as Microsoft Cognitive Services and Face++, could find potential applications in tourism, e-commerce, social media marketing, criminal justice and even counter-terrorism.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Many details about our world are not captured in written records because they are too mundane or too abstract to describe in words. Fortunately, since the invention of the camera, an ever-increasing number of photographs capture much of this otherwise lost information. This plethora of artifacts documenting our "visual culture" is a treasure trove of knowledge as yet untapped by historians. We present a dataset of 37,921 frontal-facing American high school yearbook photos that allow us to use computation to glimpse into the historical visual record too voluminous to be evaluated manually. The collected portraits provide a constant visual frame of reference with varying content. We can therefore use them to consider issues such as a decade's defining style elements, or trends in fashion and social norms over time. We demonstrate that our historical image dataset may be used together with weakly-supervised data-driven techniques to perform scalable historical analysis of large image corpora with minimal human effort, much in the same way that large text corpora together with natural language processing revolutionized historians' workflow. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of our dataset in dating grayscale portraits using deep learning methods.</data>

Using Twitter data collected from Sept. 2015 to March 2016, we first uncover the tweeting tactics of the candidates and then exploit the variations in the number of 'likes' to infer voters' preference. With sparse learning, we are able to reveal neutral topics as well as positive and negative ones. #R##N#Methodologically, we are able to achieve a higher predictive power with sparse learning. Substantively, we show that for Hillary Clinton the (only) positive issue area is women's rights. We demonstrate that Hillary Clinton's tactic of linking herself to President Obama resonates well with her supporters but the same is not true for Bernie Sanders. In addition, we show that Donald Trump is a major topic for all the other candidates, and that the women's rights issue is equally emphasized in Sanders' campaign as in Clinton's.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We develop a novel visual model which can recognize protesters, describe their activities by visual attributes and estimate the level of perceived violence in an image. Studies of social media and protests use natural language processing to track how individuals use hashtags and links, often with a focus on those items' diffusion. These approaches, however, may not be effective in fully characterizing actual real-world protests (e.g., violent or peaceful) or estimating the demographics of participants (e.g., age, gender, and race) and their emotions. Our system characterizes protests along these dimensions. We have collected geotagged tweets and their images from 2013-2017 and analyzed multiple major protest events in that period. A multi-task convolutional neural network is employed in order to automatically classify the presence of protesters in an image and predict its visual attributes, perceived violence and exhibited emotions. We also release the UCLA Protest Image Dataset, our novel dataset of 40,764 images (11,659 protest images and hard negatives) with various annotations of visual attributes and sentiments. Using this dataset, we train our model and demonstrate its effectiveness. We also present experimental results from various analysis on geotagged image data in several prevalent protest events.
