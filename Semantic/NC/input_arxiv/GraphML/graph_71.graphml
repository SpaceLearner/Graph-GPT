      <data key="title">a deterministic approach to wireless relay networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">We present a deterministic channel model which captures several key features of multiuser wireless communication. We consider a model for a wireless network with nodes connected by such deterministic channels, and present an exact characterization of the end-to-end capacity when there is a single source and a single destination and an arbitrary number of relay nodes. This result is a natural generalization of the max-flow min-cut theorem for wireline networks. Finally to demonstrate the connections between deterministic model and Gaussian model, we look at two examples: the single-relay channel and the diamond network. We show that in each of these two examples, the capacity-achieving scheme in the corresponding deterministic model naturally suggests a scheme in the Gaussian model that is within 1 bit and 2 bit respectively from cut-set upper bound, for all values of the channel gains. This is the first part of a two-part paper; the sequel [1] will focus on the proof of the max-flow min-cut theorem of a class of deterministic networks of which our model is a special case.</data>

      <data key="title">evaluating mobility pattern space routing for dtns</data>
      <data key="abstract">Because a delay tolerant network (DTN) can often be partitioned, routing is a challenge. However, routing benefits considerably if one can take advantage of knowledge concerning node mobility. This paper addresses this problem with a generic algorithm based on the use of a high-dimensional Euclidean space, that we call MobySpace, constructed upon nodes' mobility patterns. We provide here an analysis and a large scale evaluation of this routing scheme in the context of ambient networking by replaying real mobility traces. The specific MobySpace evaluated is based on the frequency of visits of nodes to each possible location. We show that routing based on MobySpace can achieve good performance compared to that of a number of standard algorithms, especially for nodes that are present in the network a large portion of the time. We determine that the degree of homogeneity of node mobility patterns has a high impact on routing. And finally, we study the ability of nodes to learn their own mobility patterns.</data>

      <data key="title">throughput capacity of two hop relay manets under finite buffers</data>
      <data key="abstract">Since the seminal work of Grossglauser and Tse [1], the two-hop relay algorithm and its variants have been attractive for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, most literature assumed an infinite buffer size for each node, which is obviously not applicable to a realistic MANET. In this paper, we focus on the exact throughput capacity study of two-hop relay MANETs under the practical finite relay buffer scenario. The arrival process and departure process of the relay queue are fully characterized, and an ergodic Markov chain-based framework is also provided. With this framework, we obtain the limiting distribution of the relay queue and derive the throughput capacity under any relay buffer size. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate our theoretical framework and explore the relationship among the throughput capacity, the relay buffer size and the number of nodes.</data>

      <data key="title">joint opportunistic scheduling and selective channel feedback</data>
      <data key="abstract">It is well known that Max-Weight type scheduling algorithms are throughput optimal since they achieve the maximum throughput while maintaining the network stability. However, the majority of existing works employing Max-Weight algorithm require the complete channel state information (CSI) at the scheduler without taking into account the associated overhead. In this work, we design a Scheduling and Selective Feedback algorithm (SSF) taking into account the overhead due to acquisition of CSI. SSF algorithm collects CSI from only those users with sufficiently good channel quality so that it always schedules the user with the highest queue backlog and channel rate product at every slot. We characterize the achievable rate region of SSF algorithm by showing that SSF supports 1 + ϵ fraction of the rate region when CSI from all users are collected. We also show that the value of ϵ depends on the expected number of users which do not send back their CSI to the base station. For homogenous and heterogeneous channel conditions, we determine the minimum number of users that must be present in the network so that the rate region is expanded, i.e., ϵ &gt; 0. We also demonstrate numerically in a realistic simulation setting that this rate region can be achieved by collecting CSI from only less than 50% of all users in a CDMA based cellular network utilizing high data rate (HDR) protocol.</data>

      <data key="title">on performance modeling for manets under general limited buffer constraint</data>
      <data key="abstract">Understanding the real achievable performance of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) under practical network constraints is of great importance for their applications in future highly heterogeneous wireless network environments. This paper explores, for the first time, the performance modeling for MANETs under a general limited buffer constraint, where each network node maintains a limited source buffer of size   $B_s$    to store its locally generated packets and also a limited shared relay buffer of size    $B_r$   to store relay packets for other nodes. Based on the Queuing theory and birth-death chain theory, we first develop a general theoretical framework to fully depict the source/relay buffer occupancy process in such a MANET, which applies to any distributed MAC protocol and any mobility model that leads to the uniform distribution of nodes’ locations in steady state. With the help of this framework, we then derive the exact expressions of several key network performance metrics, including achievable throughput, throughput capacity, and expected end-to-end delay. We further conduct case studies under two network scenarios and provide the corresponding theoretical/simulation results to demonstrate the application as well as the efficiency of our theoretical framework. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to illustrate the impacts of buffer constraint on the performance of a buffer-limited MANET.</data>

      <data key="title">cross layer modeling of randomly spread cdma using stochastic network calculus</data>
      <data key="abstract">Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) has the potential to support traffic sources with a wide range of quality of service (QoS) requirements. The traffic carrying capacity of CDMA channels under QoS constraints (such as delay guarantee) is, however, less well-understood. In this work, we propose a method based on stochastic network calculus and large system analysis to quantify the maximum traffic that can be carried by a multiuser CDMA network under the QoS constraints. At the physical layer, we have linear minimum-mean square error receivers and adaptive modulation and coding, while the channel service process is modeled by using a finite-state Markov chain. We study the impact of delay requirements, violation probability and the user load on the traffic carrying capacity under different signal strengths. A key insight provided by the numerical results is as to how much one has to back-off from capacity under the different delay requirements.</data>

      <data key="title">end to end delay modeling in buffer limited manets a general theoretical framework</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper focuses on a class of important two-hop relay mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) with limited-buffer constraint and any mobility model that leads to the uniform distribution of the locations of nodes in steady state, and develops a general theoretical framework for the end-to-end (E2E) delay modeling there. We first combine the theories of fixed-point (FP), quasi-birth-and-death process, and embedded Markov chain to model the limiting distribution of the occupancy states of a relay buffer, and then apply the absorbing Markov chain theory to characterize the packet delivery process, such that a complete theoretical framework is developed for the E2E delay analysis. With the help of this framework, we derive a general and exact expression for the E2E delay based on the modeling of both packet queuing delay and delivery delay. To demonstrate the application of our framework, case studies are further provided under two network scenarios with different MAC protocols to show how the E2E delay can be analytically determined for a given network scenario. Finally, we present extensive simulation and numerical results to illustrate the efficiency of our delay analysis as well as the impacts of network parameters on delay performance.</data>

      <data key="title">capacity and character expansions moment generating function and other exact results for mimo correlated channels</data>
      <data key="abstract">A promising new method from the field of representations of Lie groups is applied to calculate integrals over unitary groups, which are important for multiantenna communications. To demonstrate the power and simplicity of this technique, a number of recent results are rederived, using only a few simple steps. In particular, we derive the joint probability distribution of eigenvalues of the matrix GGdagger , with G a nonzero mean or a semicorrelated Gaussian random matrix. These joint probability distribution functions can then be used to calculate the moment generating function of the mutual information for Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels with these probability distribution of their channel matrices G. We then turn to the previously unsolved problem of calculating the moment generating function of the mutual information of MIMO channels, which are correlated at both the receiver and the transmitter. From this moment generating function we obtain the ergodic average of the mutual information and study the outage probability. These methods can be applied to a number of other problems. As a particular example, we examine unitary encoded space-time transmission of MIMO systems and we derive the received signal distribution when the channel matrix is correlated at the transmitter end</data>

      <data key="title">performance analysis of outdoor mmwave ad hoc networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Ad hoc networks provide an on-demand, infrastructure-free means to communicate between soldiers in war zones, aid workers in disaster areas, or consumers in device-to-device (D2D) applications. Unfortunately, ad hoc networks are limited by interference due to nearby transmissions. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) devices offer several potential advantages for ad hoc networks, including reduced interference due to directional antennas and building blockages, not to mention huge bandwidth channels for large data rates. This paper uses a stochastic geometry approach to characterize the one-way and two-way signal-to-interference ratio distribution of a mmWave ad hoc network with directional antennas, random blockages, and ALOHA channel access. The interference-to-noise ratio shows that a fundamental limitation of an ad hoc network, interference, may still be an issue. The performance of mmWave ad hoc networks is bounded by the transmission capacity and area spectral efficiency. The results show that mmWave networks can support much higher densities and larger spectral efficiencies, even in the presence of blockage, compared with lower frequency communication for certain link distances. Due to the increased bandwidth, the rate coverage of mmWave can be much greater than lower frequency devices.</data>

      <data key="title">source delay in mobile ad hoc networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Source delay, the time a packet experiences in its source node, serves as a fundamental quantity for delay performance analysis in networks. However, the source delay performance in highly dynamic mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is still largely unknown by now. This paper studies the source delay in MANETs based on a general packet dispatching scheme with dispatch limit $f$ (PD-$f$ for short), where a same packet will be dispatched out up to $f$ times by its source node such that packet dispatching process can be flexibly controlled through a proper setting of $f$. We first apply the Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) theory to develop a theoretical framework to capture the complex packet dispatching process in PD-$f$ MANETs. With the help of the theoretical framework, we then derive the cumulative distribution function as well as mean and variance of the source delay in such networks. Finally, extensive simulation and theoretical results are provided to validate our source delay analysis and illustrate how source delay in MANETs are related to network parameters.</data>

      <data key="title">network capacity region and minimum energy function for a delay tolerant mobile ad hoc network</data>
      <data key="abstract">We investigate two quantities of interest in a delay-tolerant mobile ad hoc network: the network capacity region and the minimum energy function. The network capacity region is defined as the set of all input rates that the network can stably support considering all possible scheduling and routing algorithms. Given any input rate vector in this region, the minimum energy function establishes the minimum time-average power required to support it. In this paper, we consider a cell-partitioned model of a delay-tolerant mobile ad hoc network with general Markovian mobility. This simple model incorporates the essential features of locality of wireless transmissions as well as node mobility and enables us to exactly compute the corresponding network capacity and minimum energy function. Furthermore, we propose simple schemes that offer performance guarantees that are arbitrarily close to these bounds at the cost of an increased delay.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) performance at a mobile station (MS) in a random cellular network. The cellular network is formed by base-stations (BSs) placed in a one, two or three dimensional space according to a possibly non-homogeneous Poisson point process, which is a generalization of the so-called shotgun cellular system. We develop a sequence of equivalence relations for the SCSs and use them to derive semi-analytical expressions for the coverage probability at the MS when the transmissions from each BS may be affected by random fading with arbitrary distributions as well as attenuation following arbitrary path-loss models. For homogeneous Poisson point processes in the interference-limited case with power-law path-loss model, we show that the SINR distribution is the same for all fading distributions and is not a function of the base station density. In addition, the influence of random transmission powers, power control, multiple channel reuse groups on the downlink performance are also discussed. The techniques developed for the analysis of SINR have applications beyond cellular networks and can be used in similar studies for cognitive radio networks, femtocell networks and other heterogeneous and multi-tier networks.</data>

      <data key="abstract">With the seamless coverage of wireless cellular networks in modern society, it is interesting to consider the shape of wireless cellular coverage. Is the shape a regular hexagon, an irregular polygon, or another complex geometrical shape? Based on fractal theory, the statistical characteristic of the wireless cellular coverage boundary is determined by the measured wireless cellular data collected from Shanghai, China. The measured results indicate that the wireless cellular coverage boundary presents an extremely irregular geometrical shape, which is also called a statistical fractal shape. Moreover, the statistical fractal characteristics of the wireless cellular coverage boundary have been validated by values of the Hurst parameter estimated in angular scales. The statistical fractal characteristics of the wireless cellular coverage boundary can be used to evaluate and design the handoff scheme of mobile user terminals in wireless cellular networks.</data>

      <data key="title">interference networks a complex system view</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper presents an unusual view of interference wireless networks based on complex system thinking. To proceed with this analysis, a literature review of the different applications of complex systems is firstly presented to illustrate how such an approach can be used in a wide range of research topics, from economics to linguistics. Then the problem of quantifying the fundamental limits of wireless systems where the co-channel interference is the main limiting factor is described and hence contextualized in the perspective of complex systems. Specifically some possible internal and external pressures that the network elements may suffer are identified as, for example, queue stability, maximum packet loss rate and transmit power constraint. Besides, other important external factors such as mobility and incoming traffic are also pointed out. As a study case, a decentralized point-to-point interference network is described and several claims about the optimal design setting for different network states and under two mobility conditions, namely quasi-static and highly mobile, are stated based on results found in the literature. Using these claims as a background, the design of a robust adaptive algorithm that each network element should run is investigated.</data>

      <data key="title">on the capacity of fractal d2d social networks with hierarchical communications</data>
      <data key="abstract">The maximum capacity of fractal D2D (device-to-device) social networks with both direct and hierarchical communications is studied in this paper. Specifically, the fractal networks are characterized by the direct social connection and the self-similarity. Firstly, for a fractal D2D social network with direct social communications, it is proved that the maximum capacity is $ \Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n\log n}}\right) $ if a user communicates with one of his/her direct contacts randomly, where $ n $ denotes the total number of users in the network, and it can reach up to $ \Theta\left(\frac{1}{\log n}\right) $ if any pair of social contacts with distance $ d $ communicate according to the probability in proportion to $ d^{-\beta} $. Secondly, since users might get in touch with others without direct social connections through the inter-connected multiple users, the fractal D2D social network with these hierarchical communications is studied as well, and the related capacity is further derived. Our results show that this capacity is mainly affected by the correlation exponent $\epsilon$ of the fractal structure. The capacity is reduced in proportional to $ \frac{1}{\log n} $ if $ 2 3 $.</data>

      <data key="title">fundamental limits on throughput capacity in information centric networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Author(s): Azimdoost, B; Westphal, C; Sadjadpour, HR | Abstract: Wireless information-centric networks consider storage as one of the network primitives, and propose to cache data within the network in order to improve latency and reduce bandwidth consumption. We study the throughput capacity and latency in an information-centric network when the data cached in each node has a limited lifetime. The results show that with some fixed request and cache expiration rates, the order of the data access time does not change with network growth, and the maximum throughput order is not changing with the network growth in grid networks, and is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in one cell in random networks. Comparing these values with the corresponding throughput and latency with no cache capability (throughput inversely proportional to the network size, and latency of order $\sqrt{n}$ and the inverse of the transmission range in grid and random networks, respectively), we can actually quantify the asymptotic advantage of caching. Moreover, we compare these scaling laws for different content discovery mechanisms and illustrate that not much gain is lost when a simple path search is used.</data>

      <data key="title">rethinking information theory for mobile ad hoc networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">The subject of this article is the long standing open problem of developing a general capacity theory for wireless networks, particularly a theory capable of describing the fundamental performance limits of mobile ad hoc networks. A MANET is a peer-to-peer network with no preexisting infrastructure. MANETs are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop, relay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. The lack of a MANET capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of many types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and community mesh networks. Information theory, which has been vital for links and centralized networks, has not been successfully applied to decentralized wireless networks. Even if this was accomplished, for such a theory to truly characterize the limits of deployed MANETs it must overcome three key roadblocks. First, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of unbounded delay and reliability. Second, spatial and timescale decompositions have not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of wireless networks. Third, a useful network capacity theory must integrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and feedback. This article describes some of the shifts in thinking that may be needed to overcome these roadblocks and develop a more general theory.</data>

      <data key="title">systematic topology analysis and generation using degree correlations</data>
      <data key="abstract">Researchers have proposed a variety of metrics to measure important graph properties, for instance, in social, biological, and computer networks. Values for a particular graph metric may capture a graph's resilience to failure or its routing efficiency. Knowledge of appropriate metric values may influence the engineering of future topologies, repair strategies in the face of failure, and understanding of fundamental properties of existing networks. Unfortunately, there are typically no algorithms to generate graphs matching one or more proposed metrics and there is little understanding of the relationships among individual metrics or their applicability to different settings. We present a new, systematic approach for analyzing network topologies. We first introduce the dK-series of probability distributions specifying all degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a given graph G. Increasing values of d capture progressively more properties of G at the cost of more complex representation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct random graphs that accurately reproduce virtually all metrics proposed in the literature. The nature of the dK-series implies that it will also capture any future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we construct graphs for d=0, 1, 2, 3 and demonstrate that these graphs reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important properties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We find that the d=2 case is sufficient for most practical purposes, while d=3 essentially reconstructs the Internet AS-and router-level topologies exactly. We hope that a systematic method to analyze and synthesize topologies offers a significant improvement to the set of tools available to network topology and protocol researchers.</data>

      <data key="title">on throughput capacity for a class of buffer limited manets</data>
      <data key="abstract">Available throughput performance studies for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) suffer from two major limitations: they mainly focus on the scaling law study of throughput, while the exact throughput of such networks remains largely unknown; they usually consider the infinite buffer scenarios, which are not applicable to the practical networks with limited buffer. As a step to address these limitations, this paper develops a general framework for the exact throughput capacity study of a class of buffer-limited MANETs with the two-hop relay. We first provide analysis to reveal how the throughput capacity of such a MANET is determined by its relay-buffer blocking probability (RBP). Based on the Embedded Markov Chain Theory and Queuing Theory, a novel theoretical framework is then developed to enable the RBP and closed-form expression for exact throughput capacity to be derived. We further conduct case studies under two typical transmission scheduling schemes to illustrate the applicability of our framework and to explore the corresponding capacity optimization as well as capacity scaling law. Finally, extensive simulation and numerical results are provided to validate the efficiency of our framework and to show the impacts brought by the buffer constraint.</data>

      <data key="title">throughput and delay in random wireless networks with restricted mobility</data>
      <data key="abstract">Grossglauser and Tse (2001) introduced a mobile random network model where each node moves independently on a unit disk according to a stationary uniform distribution and showed that a throughput of $\Theta(1)$ is achievable. El Gamal, Mammen, Prabhakar and Shah (2004) showed that the delay associated with this throughput scales as $\Theta(n\log n)$, when each node moves according to an independent random walk. In a later work, Diggavi, Grossglauser and Tse (2002) considered a random network on a sphere with a restricted mobility model, where each node moves along a randomly chosen great circle on the unit sphere. They showed that even with this one-dimensional restriction on mobility, constant throughput scaling is achievable. Thus, this particular mobility restriction does not affect the throughput scaling. This raises the question whether this mobility restriction affects the delay scaling. #R##N#This paper studies the delay scaling at $\Theta(1)$ throughput for a random network with restricted mobility. First, a variant of the scheme presented by Diggavi, Grossglauser and Tse (2002) is presented and it is shown to achieve $\Theta(1)$ throughput using different (and perhaps simpler) techniques. The exact order of delay scaling for this scheme is determined, somewhat surprisingly, to be of $\Theta(n\log n)$, which is the same as that without the mobility restriction. Thus, this particular mobility restriction \emph{does not} affect either the maximal throughput scaling or the corresponding delay scaling of the network. This happens because under this 1-D restriction, each node is in the proximity of every other node in essentially the same manner as without this restriction.</data>
