      <data key="title">feedback vertex set inspired kernel for chordal vertex deletion</data>
      <data key="abstract">Given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, the Chordal Vertex Deletion (CVD) problem asks whether there exists a subset $U\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ that hits all induced cycles of size at least 4. The existence of a polynomial kernel for CVD was a well-known open problem in the field of Parameterized Complexity. Recently, Jansen and Pilipczuk resolved this question affirmatively by designing a polynomial kernel for CVD of size $O(k^{161}\log^{58}k)$, and asked whether one can design a kernel of size $O(k^{10})$. While we do not completely resolve this question, we design a significantly smaller kernel of size $O(k^{12}\log^{10}k)$, inspired by the $O(k^2)$-size kernel for Feedback Vertex Set. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of the independence degree of a vertex, which is our main conceptual contribution.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We study the satisfiability of ordering constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) above average. We prove the conjecture of Gutin, van Iersel, Mnich, and Yeo that the satisfiability above average of ordering CSPs of arity $k$ is fixed-parameter tractable for every $k$. Previously, this was only known for $k=2$ and $k=3$. We also generalize this result to more general classes of CSPs, including CSPs with predicates defined by linear inequalities. #R##N#To obtain our results, we prove a new Bonami-type inequality for the Efron-Stein decomposition. The inequality applies to functions defined on arbitrary product probability spaces. In contrast to other variants of the Bonami Inequality, it does not depend on the mass of the smallest atom in the probability space. We believe that this inequality is of independent interest.</data>

      <data key="title">parameterized aspects of strong subgraph closure</data>
      <data key="abstract">Motivated by the role of triadic closures in social networks, and the importance of finding a maximum subgraph avoiding a fixed pattern, we introduce and initiate the parameterized study of the Strong F-closure problem, where F is a fixed graph. This is a generalization of Strong Triadic Closure, whereas it is a relaxation of F-free Edge Deletion. In Strong F-closure, we want to select a maximum number of edges of the input graph G, and mark them as strong edges, in the following way: whenever a subset of the strong edges forms a subgraph isomorphic to F, then the corresponding induced subgraph of G is not isomorphic to F. Hence the subgraph of G defined by the strong edges is not necessarily F-free, but whenever it contains a copy of F, there are additional edges in G to destroy that strong copy of F in G. #R##N#We study Strong F-closure from a parameterized perspective with various natural parameterizations. Our main focus is on the number k of strong edges as the parameter. We show that the problem is FPT with this parameterization for every fixed graph F, whereas it does not admit a polynomial kernel even when F =P_3. In fact, this latter case is equivalent to the Strong Triadic Closure problem, which motivates us to study this problem on input graphs belonging to well known graph classes. We show that Strong Triadic Closure does not admit a polynomial kernel even when the input graph is a split graph, whereas it admits a polynomial kernel when the input graph is planar, and even d-degenerate. Furthermore, on graphs of maximum degree at most 4, we show that Strong Triadic Closure is FPT with the above guarantee parameterization k - \mu(G), where \mu(G) is the maximum matching size of G. We conclude with some results on the parameterization of Strong F-closure by the number of edges of G that are not selected as strong.</data>

      <data key="title">meta kernelization using well structured modulators</data>
      <data key="abstract">Kernelization investigates exact preprocessing algorithms with performance guarantees. The most prevalent type of parameters used in kernelization is the solution size for optimization problems; however, also structural parameters have been successfully used to obtain polynomial kernels for a wide range of problems. Many of these parameters can be defined as the size of a smallest modulator of the given graph into a fixed graph class (i.e., a set of vertices whose deletion puts the graph into the graph class). Such parameters admit the construction of polynomial kernels even when the solution size is large or not applicable. This work follows up on the research on meta-kernelization frameworks in terms of structural parameters. #R##N#We develop a class of parameters which are based on a more general view on modulators: instead of size, the parameters employ a combination of rank-width and split decompositions to measure structure inside the modulator. This allows us to lift kernelization results from modulator-size to more general parameters, hence providing smaller kernels. We show (i) how such large but well-structured modulators can be efficiently approximated, (ii) how they can be used to obtain polynomial kernels for any graph problem expressible in Monadic Second Order logic, and (iii) how they allow the extension of previous results in the area of structural meta-kernelization.</data>

      <data key="title">improved parameterized algorithms for constraint satisfaction</data>
      <data key="abstract">For many constraint satisfaction problems, the algorithm which chooses a random assignment achieves the best possible approximation ratio. For instance, a simple random assignment for {\sc Max-E3-Sat} allows 7/8-approximation and for every $\eps &gt;0$ there is no polynomial-time ($7/8+\eps$)-approximation unless P=NP. Another example is the {\sc Permutation CSP} of bounded arity. Given the expected fraction $\rho$ of the constraints satisfied by a random assignment (i.e. permutation), there is no $(\rho+\eps)$-approximation algorithm for every $\eps &gt;0$, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). #R##N#In this work, we consider the following parameterization of constraint satisfaction problems. Given a set of $m$ constraints of constant arity, can we satisfy at least $\rho m +k$ constraint, where $\rho$ is the expected fraction of constraints satisfied by a random assignment? {\sc Constraint Satisfaction Problems above Average} have been posed in different forms in the literature \cite{Niedermeier2006,MahajanRamanSikdar09}. We present a faster parameterized algorithm for deciding whether $m/2+k/2$ equations can be simultaneously satisfied over ${\mathbb F}_2$. As a consequence, we obtain $O(k)$-variable bikernels for {\sc boolean CSPs} of arity $c$ for every fixed $c$, and for {\sc permutation CSPs} of arity 3. This implies linear bikernels for many problems under the "above average" parameterization, such as {\sc Max-$c$-Sat}, {\sc Set-Splitting}, {\sc Betweenness} and {\sc Max Acyclic Subgraph}. As a result, all the parameterized problems we consider in this paper admit $2^{O(k)}$-time algorithms. #R##N#We also obtain non-trivial hybrid algorithms for every Max $c$-CSP: for every instance $I$, we can either approximate $I$ beyond the random assignment threshold in polynomial time, or we can find an optimal solution to $I$ in subexponential time.</data>

(ICALP 2008) and Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) allows us to exclude the existence of polynomial kernels for a range of problems under reasonable complexity-theoretical assumptions. However, there are also some issues that are not addressed by this framework, including the existence of Turing kernels such as the "kernelization" of Leaf Out Branching(k) into a disjunction over n instances of size poly(k). Observing that Turing kernels are preserved by polynomial parametric transformations, we define a kernelization hardness hierarchy, akin to the M- and W-hierarchy of ordinary parameterized complexity, by the PPT-closure of problems that seem likely to be fundamentally hard for efficient Turing kernelization. We find that several previously considered problems are complete for our fundamental hardness class, including Min Ones d-SAT(k), Binary NDTM Halting(k), Connected Vertex Cover(k), and Clique(k log n), the clique problem parameterized by k log n.</data>

By the classical theorem of Erdős and Gallai from 1959, every graph of degeneracy d&gt;1 contains a cycle of length at least d+1. The proof of Erdős and Gallai is constructive and can be turned into a polynomial time algorithm constructing a cycle of length at least d+1. But can we decide in polynomial time whether a graph contains a cycle of length at least d+2? An easy reduction from Hamiltonian Cycle provides a negative answer to this question: deciding whether a graph has a cycle of length at least d+2 is NP-complete. Surprisingly, the complexity of the problem changes drastically when the input graph is 2-connected. In this case we prove that deciding whether G contains a cycle of length at least d+k can be done in time 2^{O(k)}|V(G)|^{O(1)}. In other words, deciding whether a 2-connected n-vertex G contains a cycle of length at least d+log n can be done in polynomial time. #R##N#Similar algorithmic results hold for long paths in graphs.

The Metric Dimension problem, i.e. deciding whether ${\rm md}(G)\le k$, is NP-complete even for interval graphs (Foucaud et al., 2017). We study Metric Dimension (for arbitrary graphs) from the lens of parameterized complexity. The problem parameterized by $k$ was proved to be $W[2]$-hard by Hartung and Nichterlein (2013) and we study the dual parameterization, i.e., the problem of whether ${\rm md}(G)\le n- k,$ where $n$ is the order of $G$. We prove that the dual parameterization admits (a) a kernel with at most $3k^4$ vertices and (b) an algorithm of runtime $O^*(4^{k+o(k)}).$ Hartung and Nichterlein (2013) also observed that Metric Dimension is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number $vc(G)$ of the input graph.
