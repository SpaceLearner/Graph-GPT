      <data key="title">detecting friendship within dynamic online interaction networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In many complex social systems, the timing and frequency of interactions between individuals are observable but friendship ties are hidden. Recovering these hidden ties, particularly for casual users who are relatively less active, would enable a wide variety of friendship-aware applications in domains where labeled data are often unavailable, including online advertising and national security. Here, we investigate the accuracy of multiple statistical features, based either purely on temporal interaction patterns or on the cooperative nature of the interactions, for automatically extracting latent social ties. Using self-reported friendship and non-friendship labels derived from an anonymous online survey, we learn highly accurate predictors for recovering hidden friendships within a massive online data set encompassing 18 billion interactions among 17 million individuals of the popular online game Halo: Reach. We find that the accuracy of many features improves as more data accumulates, and cooperative features are generally reliable. However, periodicities in interaction time series are sufficient to correctly classify 95% of ties, even for casual users. These results clarify the nature of friendship in online social environments and suggest new opportunities and new privacy concerns for friendship-aware applications that do not require the disclosure of private friendship information.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The prevalence of online media has attracted researchers from various domains to explore human behavior and make interesting predictions. In this research, we leverage heterogeneous data collected from various online platforms to predict Taiwan’s 2016 general election. In contrast to most existing research, we take a “signal” view of heterogeneous information and adopt the Kalman filter to fuse multiple signals into daily vote predictions for the candidates. We also consider events that influenced the election in a quantitative manner based on the so-called event study model that originated in the field of financial research. We obtained the following interesting findings. First, public opinions in online media dominate traditional polls in Taiwan election prediction in terms of both predictive power and timeliness. But offline polls can still function on alleviating the sample bias of online opinions. Second, although online signals converge as election day approaches, the simple Facebook “Like” is consistently the strongest indicator of the election result. Third, most influential events have a strong connection to cross-strait relations, and the Chou Tzu-yu flag incident followed by the apology video one day before the election increased the vote share of Tsai Ing-Wen by 3.66%. This research justifies the predictive power of online media in politics and the advantages of information fusion. The combined use of the Kalman filter and the event study method contributes to the data-driven political analytics paradigm for both prediction and attribution purposes.</data>

      <data key="title">triangles to capture social cohesion</data>
      <data key="abstract">Although community detection has drawn tremendous amount of attention across the sciences in the past decades, no formal consensus has been reached on the very nature of what qualifies a community as such. In this article we take an orthogonal approach by introducing a novel point of view to the problem of overlapping communities. Instead of quantifying the quality of a set of communities, we choose to focus on the intrinsic community-ness of one given set of nodes. To do so, we propose a general metric on graphs, the cohesion, based on counting triangles and inspired by well established sociological considerations. The model has been validated through a large-scale online experiment called Fellows in which users were able to compute their social groups on Face- book and rate the quality of the obtained groups. By observing those ratings in relation to the cohesion we assess that the cohesion is a strong indicator of users subjective perception of the community-ness of a set of people.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. In particular, our methodology facilitates additional qualitative analysis by measuring whether these divergences result from widespread discussion or a few popular retweets within these groups. We find that #BlackLivesMatter exhibits many informationally rich conversations, while those within #AllLivesMatter are more muted and susceptible to hijacking. We also show that the discussion within #BlackLivesMatter is more likely to center around the deaths of Black Americans, while that of #AllLivesMatter is more likely to sympathize with the lives of police officers and express politically conservative views.</data>

      <data key="abstract">One of the key aspects of the United States democracy is free and fair elections that allow for a peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next. The 2016 US presidential election stands out due to suspected foreign influence before, during, and after the election. A significant portion of that suspected influence was carried out via social media. In this paper, we look specifically at 3,500 Facebook ads allegedly purchased by the Russian government. These ads were released on May 10, 2018 by the US Congress House Intelligence Committee. We analyzed the ads using natural language processing techniques to determine textual and semantic features associated with the most effective ones. We clustered the ads over time into the various campaigns and the labeled parties associated with them. We also studied the effectiveness of Ads on an individual, campaign and party basis. The most effective ads tend to have less positive sentiment, focus on past events and are more specific and personalized in nature. The more effective campaigns also show such similar characteristics. The campaigns' duration and promotion of the Ads suggest a desire to sow division rather than sway the election.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Computational Social Science emerged as a highly technical and popular discipline in the last few years, owing to the substantial advances in communication technology and daily production of vast quantities of personal data. As per capita data production significantly increased in the last decade, both in terms of its size, bytes, as well as its detail, heart rate monitors, Internet connected appliances, smartphones, social scientists ability to extract meaningful social, political and demographic information from digital data also increased. A vast methodological gap exists in computational international relations, or ComInt, which refers to the use of one or a combination of tools such as data mining, natural language processing, automated text analysis, web scraping, geospatial analysis and machine learning to provide larger and better organized data to test more advanced theories of IR. After providing an overview of the potentials of computational IR and how an IR scholar can establish technical proficiency in computer science, such as starting with Python, R, QGis, ArcGIS or Github, this paper will focus on some of the author's works in providing an idea for IR students on how to think about computational IR. The paper argues that computational methods transcend the methodological schism between qualitative and quantitative approaches and form a solid foundation for building truly multi method research design.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Under what conditions is an edge present in a social network at time t likely to decay or persist by some future time t + Delta(t)? Previous research addressing this issue suggests that the network range of the people involved in the edge, the extent to which the edge is embedded in a surrounding structure, and the age of the edge all play a role in edge decay. This paper uses weighted data from a large-scale social network built from cell-phone calls in an 8-week period to determine the importance of edge weight for the decay/persistence process. In particular, we study the relative predictive power of directed weight, embeddedness, newness, and range (measured as outdegree) with respect to edge decay and assess the effectiveness with which a simple decision tree and logistic regression classifier can accurately predict whether an edge that was active in one time period continues to be so in a future time period. We find that directed edge weight, weighted reciprocity and time-dependent measures of edge longevity are highly predictive of whether we classify an edge as persistent or decayed, relative to the other types of factors at the dyad and neighborhood level.</data>

      <data key="title">topological properties and temporal dynamics of place networks in urban environments</data>
      <data key="abstract">Understanding the spatial networks formed by the trajectories of mobile users can be beneficial to applications ranging from epidemiology to local search. Despite the potential for impact in a number of fields, several aspects of human mobility networks remain largely unexplored due to the lack of large-scale data at a fine spatiotemporal resolution. Using a longitudinal dataset from the location-based service Foursquare, we perform an empirical analysis of the topological properties of place networks and note their resemblance to online social networks in terms of heavy-tailed degree distributions, triadic closure mechanisms and the small world property. Unlike social networks however, place networks present a mixture of connectivity trends in terms of assortativity that are surprisingly similar to those of the web graph. We take advantage of additional semantic information to interpret how nodes that take on functional roles such as `travel hub', or `food spot' behave in these networks. Finally, motivated by the large volume of new links appearing in place networks over time, we formulate the classic link prediction problem in this new domain. We propose a novel variant of gravity models that brings together three essential elements of inter-place connectivity in urban environments: network-level interactions, human mobility dynamics, and geographic distance. We evaluate this model and find it outperforms a number of baseline predictors and supervised learning algorithms on a task of predicting new links in a sample of one hundred popular cities.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Link prediction appears as a central problem of network science, as it calls for unfolding the mechanisms that govern the micro-dynamics of the network. In this work, we are interested in ego-networks, that is the mere information of interactions of a node to its neighbors, in the context of social relationships. As the structural information is very poor, we rely on another source of information to predict links among egos' neighbors: the timing of interactions. We define several features to capture different kinds of temporal information and apply machine learning methods to combine these various features and improve the quality of the prediction. We demonstrate the efficiency of this temporal approach on a cellphone interaction dataset, pointing out features which prove themselves to perform well in this context, in particular the temporal profile of interactions and elapsed time between contacts.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Several research studies have shown that complex networks modeling real-world phenomena are characterized by striking properties: (i) they are organized according to community structure, and (ii) their structure evolves with time. Many researchers have worked on methods that can efficiently unveil substructures in complex networks, giving birth to the field of community discovery. A novel and fascinating problem started capturing researcher interest recently: the identification of evolving communities. Dynamic networks can be used to model the evolution of a system: nodes and edges are mutable, and their presence, or absence, deeply impacts the community structure that composes them.#R##N##R##N#This survey aims to present the distinctive features and challenges of dynamic community discovery and propose a classification of published approaches. As a “user manual,” this work organizes state-of-the-art methodologies into a taxonomy, based on their rationale, and their specific instantiation. Given a definition of network dynamics, desired community characteristics, and analytical needs, this survey will support researchers to identify the set of approaches that best fit their needs. The proposed classification could also help researchers choose in which direction to orient their future research.</data>

      <data key="title">estimating local commuting patterns from geolocated twitter data</data>
      <data key="abstract">The emergence of large stores of transactional data generated by increasing use of digital devices presents a huge opportunity for policymakers to improve their knowledge of the local environment and thus make more informed and better decisions. A research frontier is hence emerging which involves exploring the type of measures that can be drawn from data stores such as mobile phone logs, Internet searches and contributions to social media platforms, and the extent to which these measures are accurate reflections of the wider population. This paper contributes to this research frontier, by exploring the extent to which local commuting patterns can be estimated from data drawn from Twitter. It makes three contributions in particular. First, it shows that simple heuristics drawn from geolocated Twitter data offer a good proxy for local commuting patterns; one which outperforms the major existing method for estimating these patterns (the radiation model). Second, it investigates sources of error in the proxy measure, showing that the model performs better on short trips with higher volumes of commuters; it also looks at demographic biases but finds that, surprisingly, measurements are not significantly affected by the fact that the demographic makeup of Twitter users differs significantly from the population as a whole. Finally, it looks at potential ways of going beyond simple heuristics by incorporating temporal information into models.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Nowadays, information describing navigation behaviour of internet users are used in several fields, e-commerce, economy, sociology and data science. Such information can be extracted from different knowledge bases, including business-oriented ones. In this paper, we propose a new model for the PageRank, CheiRank and 2DRank algorithm based on the use of clickstream and pageviews data in the google matrix construction. We used data from Wikipedia and analysed links between over 20 million articles from 11 language editions. We extracted over 1.4 billion source-destination pairs of articles from SQL dumps and more than 700 million pairs from XML dumps. Additionally, we unified the pairs based on the analysis of redirect pages and removed all duplicates. Moreover, we also created a bigger network of Wikipedia articles based on all considered language versions and obtained multilingual measures. Based on real data, we discussed the difference between standard PageRank, Cheirank, 2DRank and measures obtained based on our approach in separate languages and multilingual network of Wikipedia.</data>

      <data key="title">dynamical classes of collective attention in twitter</data>
      <data key="abstract">Micro-blogging systems such as Twitter expose digital traces of social discourse with an unprecedented degree of resolution of individual behaviors. They offer an opportunity to investigate how a large-scale social system responds to exogenous or endogenous stimuli, and to disentangle the temporal, spatial and topical aspects of users' activity. Here we focus on spikes of collective attention in Twitter, and specifically on peaks in the popularity of hashtags. Users employ hashtags as a form of social annotation, to define a shared context for a specific event, topic, or meme. We analyze a large-scale record of Twitter activity and find that the evolution of hastag popularity over time defines discrete classes of hashtags. We link these dynamical classes to the events the hashtags represent and use text mining techniques to provide a semantic characterization of the hastag classes. Moreover, we track the propagation of hashtags in the Twitter social network and find that epidemic spreading plays a minor role in hastag popularity, which is mostly driven by exogenous factors.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This aim of this article is to explore the potential use of Wikipedia page view data for predicting electoral results. Responding to previous critiques of work using socially generated data to predict elections, which have argued that these predictions take place without any understanding of the mechanism which enables them, we first develop a theoretical model which highlights why people might seek information online at election time, and how this activity might relate to overall electoral outcomes, focussing especially on information seeking incentives related to swing voters and new parties. We test this model on a novel dataset drawn from a variety of countries in the 2009 and 2014 European Parliament elections. We show that while Wikipedia offers little insight into absolute vote outcomes, it does offer good information about changes in overall turnout at elections and about changes in vote share for particular parties. These results are used to enhance existing theories about the drivers of aggregate patterns in online information seeking, by suggesting that voters are cognitive misers who seek information only when considering changing their vote.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Apples, porcupines, and the most obscure Bob Dylan song---is every topic a few clicks from Philosophy? Within Wikipedia, the surprising answer is yes: nearly all paths lead to Philosophy. Wikipedia is the largest, most meticulously indexed collection of human knowledge ever amassed. More than information about a topic, Wikipedia is a web of naturally emerging relationships. By following the first link in each article, we algorithmically construct a directed network of all 4.7 million articles: Wikipedia's First Link Network. Here, we study the English edition of Wikipedia's First Link Network for insight into how the many articles on inventions, places, people, objects, and events are related and organized. #R##N#By traversing every path, we measure the accumulation of first links, path lengths, groups of path-connected articles, and cycles. We also develop a new method, traversal funnels, to measure the influence each article exerts in shaping the network. Traversal funnels provides a new measure of influence for directed networks without spill-over into cycles, in contrast to traditional network centrality measures. Within Wikipedia's First Link Network, we find scale-free distributions describe path length, accumulation, and influence. Far from dispersed, first links disproportionately accumulate at a few articles---flowing from specific to general and culminating around fundamental notions such as Community, State, and Science. Philosophy directs more paths than any other article by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a gravitation towards topical articles such as Health Care and Fossil Fuel. These findings enrich our view of the connections and structure of Wikipedia's ever growing store of knowledge.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This study shows how liking politicians’ public Facebook posts can be used as an accurate measure for predicting present-day voter intention in a multiparty system. We highlight that a few, but selective digital traces produce prediction accuracies that are on par or even greater than most current approaches based upon bigger and broader datasets. Combining the online and offline, we connect a subsample of surveyed respondents to their public Facebook activity and apply machine learning classifiers to explore the link between their political liking behaviour and actual voting intention. Through this work, we show that even a single selective Facebook like can reveal as much about political voter intention as hundreds of heterogeneous likes. Further, by including the entire political like history of the respondents, our model reaches prediction accuracies above previous multiparty studies (60–70%).#R##N##R##N#The main contribution of this paper is to show how public like-activity on Facebook allows political profiling of individual users in a multiparty system with accuracies above previous studies. Beside increased accuracies, the paper shows how such parsimonious measures allows us to generalize our findings to the entire population of a country and even across national borders, to other political multiparty systems. The approach in this study relies on data that are publicly available, and the simple setup we propose can with some limitations, be generalized to millions of users in other multiparty systems.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The digital traces we leave behind when engaging with the modern world offer an interesting lens through which we study behavioral patterns as expression of gender. Although gender differentiation has been observed in a number of settings, the majority of studies focus on a single data stream in isolation. Here we use a dataset of high resolution data collected using mobile phones, as well as detailed questionnaires, to study gender differences in a large cohort. We consider mobility behavior and individual personality traits among a group of more than 800 university students. We also investigate interactions among them expressed via person-to-person contacts, interactions on online social networks, and telecommunication. Thus, we are able to study the differences between male and female behavior captured through a multitude of channels for a single cohort. We find that while the two genders are similar in a number of aspects, there are robust deviations that include multiple facets of social interactions, suggesting the existence of inherent behavioral differences. Finally, we quantify how aspects of an individual’s characteristics and social behavior reveals their gender by posing it as a classification problem. We ask: How well can we distinguish between male and female study participants based on behavior alone? Which behavioral features are most predictive?</data>

Using a supervised learning method, we are able to model the dynamic of our system to improve the prediction.

      <data key="abstract">Politicians all over the world are investing considerable time and effort in both creating and curating social media profiles, with many sending hundreds or even thousands of messages over social platforms during election time, often with the help of trained and professional staff. However, there have been only a handful of papers that have sought to test whether active campaigning on social media actually makes a positive difference to vote share outcomes. All of these studies are based on cross-sectional datasets from one election period that make separating true relationships from unobserved variables problematic. Hence empirical evidence on the actual impact of social media campaigning is thin. #R##N#We analyse data from the first panel study of candidate social media use during elections, based on Twitter use in the 2015 and 2017 elections in the United Kingdom. We find support for the idea that Twitter based campaigning is associated with voting outcomes, a finding which is robust to a variety of different model specifications and a strong empirical test using a two wave panel design. Furthermore, we show that while the impact of Twitter use is small in absolute terms, it is nevertheless comparable with that of increased campaign spending, and could conceivably make a difference in a close electoral race. We use our results to advance theory around the impact of social media use on voter behaviour.</data>
