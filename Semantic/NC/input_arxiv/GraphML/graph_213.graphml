      <data key="title">context aware computing for the internet of things a survey</data>
      <data key="abstract">As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.</data>

      <data key="title">mosden a scalable mobile collaborative platform for opportunistic sensing applications</data>
      <data key="abstract">Mobile smartphones along with embedded sensors have become an efficient enabler for various mobile applications including opportunistic sensing. The hi-tech advances in smartphones are opening up a world of possibilities. This paper proposes a mobile collaborative platform called MOSDEN that enables and supports opportunistic sensing at run time. MOSDEN captures and shares sensor data across multiple apps, smartphones and users. MOSDEN supports the emerging trend of separating sensors from application-specific processing, storing and sharing. MOSDEN promotes reuse and re-purposing of sensor data hence reducing the efforts in developing novel opportunistic sensing applications. MOSDEN has been implemented on Android-based smartphones and tablets. Experimental evaluations validate the scalability and energy efficiency of MOSDEN and its suitability towards real world applications. The results of evaluation and lessons learned are presented and discussed in this paper.</data>

      <data key="title">internet of things iot a vision architectural elements and future directions</data>
      <data key="abstract">Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies such as RFID tags and readers, near field communication (NFC) devices and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.</data>

      <data key="title">cognitive internet of things a new paradigm beyond connection</data>
      <data key="abstract">Current research on Internet of Things (IoT) mainly focuses on how to enable general objects to see, hear, and smell the physical world for themselves, and make them connected to share the observations. In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds by themselves. This practical need impels us to develop a new paradigm, named Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), to empower the current IoT with a `brain' for high-level intelligence. Specifically, we first present a comprehensive definition for CIoT, primarily inspired by the effectiveness of human cognition. Then, we propose an operational framework of CIoT, which mainly characterizes the interactions among five fundamental cognitive tasks: perception-action cycle, massive data analytics, semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, intelligent decision-making, and on-demand service provisioning. Furthermore, we provide a systematic tutorial on key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks. In addition, we also discuss the design of proper performance metrics on evaluating the enabling techniques. Last but not least, we present the research challenges and open issues ahead. Building on the present work and potentially fruitful future studies, CIoT has the capability to bridge the physical world (with objects, resources, etc.) and the social world (with human demand, social behavior, etc.), and enhance smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The increasing generation and collection of personal data has created a complex ecosystem, often collaborative but sometimes combative, around companies and individuals engaging in the use of these data. We propose that the interactions between these agents warrants a new topic of study: Human-Data Interaction (HDI). In this paper we discuss how HDI sits at the intersection of various disciplines, including computer science, statistics, sociology, psychology and behavioural economics. We expose the challenges that HDI raises, organised into three core themes of legibility, agency and negotiability, and we present the HDI agenda to open up a dialogue amongst interested parties in the personal and big data ecosystems.</data>

      <data key="title">efficient opportunistic sensing using mobile collaborative platform mosden</data>
      <data key="abstract">Mobile devices are rapidly becoming the primary computing device in people's lives. Application delivery platforms like Google Play, Apple App Store have transformed mobile phones into intelligent computing devices by the means of applications that can be downloaded and installed instantly. Many of these applications take advantage of the plethora of sensors installed on the mobile device to deliver enhanced user experience. The sensors on the smartphone provide the opportunity to develop innovative mobile opportunistic sensing applications in many sectors including healthcare, environmental monitoring and transportation. In this paper, we present a collaborative mobile sensing framework namely Mobile Sensor Data EngiNe (MOSDEN) that can operate on smartphones capturing and sharing sensed data between multiple distributed applications and users. MOSDEN follows a component-based design philosophy promoting reuse for easy and quick opportunistic sensing application deployments. MOSDEN separates the application-specific processing from the sensing, storing and sharing. MOSDEN is scalable and requires minimal development effort from the application developer. We have implemented our framework on Android-based mobile platforms and evaluate its performance to validate the feasibility and efficiency of MOSDEN to operate collaboratively in mobile opportunistic sensing applications. Experimental outcomes and lessons learnt conclude the paper.</data>

      <data key="title">big data model simulation on a graph database for surveillance in wireless multimedia sensor networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   Sensors are present in various forms all around the world such as mobile phones, surveillance cameras, smart televisions, intelligent refrigerators and blood pressure monitors. Usually, most of the sensors are a part of some other system with similar sensors that compose a network. One of such networks is composed of millions of sensors connected to the Internet which is called Internet of Things (IoT). With the advances in wireless communication technologies, multimedia sensors and their networks are expected to be major components in IoT. Many studies have already been done on wireless multimedia sensor networks in diverse domains like fire detection, city surveillance, early warning systems, etc. All those applications position sensor nodes and collect their data for a long time period with real-time data flow, which is considered as big data. Big data may be structured or unstructured and needs to be stored for further processing and analyzing. Analyzing multimedia big data is a challenging task requiring a high-level modeling to efficiently extract valuable information/knowledge from data. In this study, we propose a big database model based on graph database model for handling data generated by wireless multimedia sensor networks. We introduce a simulator to generate synthetic data and store and query big data using graph model as a big database. For this purpose, we evaluate the well-known graph-based NoSQL databases, Neo4j and OrientDB, and a relational database, MySQL. We have run a number of query experiments on our implemented simulator to show that which database system(s) for surveillance in wireless multimedia sensor networks is efficient and scalable.</data>

      <data key="title">estimation of graphlet statistics</data>
      <data key="abstract">Graphlets are induced subgraphs of a large network and are important for understanding and modeling complex networks. Despite their practical importance, graphlets have been severely limited to applications and domains with relatively small graphs. Most previous work has focused on exact algorithms, however, it is often too expensive to compute graphlets exactly in massive networks with billions of edges, and finding an approximate count is usually sufficient for many applications. In this work, we propose an unbiased graphlet estimation framework that is (a) fast with significant speedups compared to the state-of-the-art, (b) parallel with nearly linear-speedups, (c) accurate with &lt;1% relative error, (d) scalable and space-efficient for massive networks with billions of edges, and (e) flexible for a variety of real-world settings, as well as estimating macro and micro-level graphlet statistics (e.g., counts) of both connected and disconnected graphlets. In addition, an adaptive approach is introduced that finds the smallest sample size required to obtain estimates within a given user-defined error bound. On 300 networks from 20 domains, we obtain &lt;1% relative error for all graphlets. This is significantly more accurate than existing methods while using less data. Moreover, it takes a few seconds on billion edge graphs (as opposed to days/weeks). These are by far the largest graphlet computations to date.</data>

      <data key="title">big data and the internet of things</data>
      <data key="abstract">Advances in sensing and computing capabilities are making it possible to embed increasing computing power in small devices. This has enabled the sensing devices not just to passively capture data at very high resolution but also to take sophisticated actions in response. Combined with advances in communication, this results in an ecosystem of highly interconnected devices referred to as the Internet of Things—IoT. In conjunction, the advances in machine learning have allowed building models on this ever increasing amount of data. Consequently, devices all the way from heavy assets such as aircraft engines to wearables such as health monitors can all now not only generate massive amounts of data but can draw back on aggregate analytics to “improve” their performance over time. Big data analytics has been identified as a key enabler for the IoT. In this chapter, we discuss various avenues of the IoT where big data analytics either is already making a significant impact or is on the cusp of doing so. We also discuss social implications and areas of concern.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network consisting of Internet-connected objects, such as radio frequency identifications, sensors, and actuators, as well as other instruments and smart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the Internet. Over the last few years, we have seen a plethora of IoT solutions making their way into the industry marketplace. Context-aware communications and computing have played a critical role throughout the last few years of ubiquitous computing and are expected to play a significant role in the IoT paradigm as well. In this paper, we examine a variety of popular and innovative IoT solutions in terms of context-aware technology perspectives. More importantly, we evaluate these IoT solutions using a framework that we built around well-known context-aware computing theories. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for context-aware product development and research in the IoT paradigm. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing IoT products in the marketplace and highlights a number of potentially significant research directions and trends.</data>

      <data key="title">distributed scheduling of event analytics across edge and cloud</data>
      <data key="abstract">Internet of Things (IoT) domains generate large volumes of high velocity event streams from sensors, which need to be analyzed with low latency to drive decisions. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a Big Data technique to enable such analytics, and is traditionally performed on Cloud Virtual Machines (VM). Leveraging captive IoT edge resources in combination with Cloud VMs can offer better performance, flexibility and monetary costs for CEP. Here, we formulate an optimization problem for energy-aware placement of CEP queries, composed as an analytics dataflow, across a collection of edge and Cloud resources, with the goal of minimizing the end-to-end latency for the dataflow. We propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) meta-heuristic to solve this problem, and compare it against a brute-force optimal algorithm (BF). We perform detailed real-world benchmarks on the compute, network and energy capacity of edge and Cloud resources. These results are used to define a realistic and comprehensive simulation study that validates the BF and GA solutions for 45 diverse CEP dataflows, LAN and WAN setup, and different edge resource availability. We compare the GA and BF solutions against random and Cloud-only baselines for different configurations, for a total of 1764 simulation runs. Our study shows that GA is within 97% of the optimal BF solution that takes hours, maps dataflows with 4 - 50 queries in 1 - 26 secs, and only fails to offer a feasible solution &lt;= 20% of the time.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of the Internet of the future and will comprise billions of intelligent communicating “things” or Internet Connected Objects (ICOs) that will have sensing, actuating, and data processing capabilities. Each ICO will have one or more embedded sensors that will capture potentially enormous amounts of data. The sensors and related data streams can be clustered physically or virtually, which raises the challenge of searching and selecting the right sensors for a query in an efficient and effective way. This paper proposes a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model, called CASSARAM, to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. CASSARAM considers user preferences and a broad range of sensor characteristics such as reliability, accuracy, location, battery life, and many more. This paper highlights the importance of sensor search, selection and ranking for the IoT, identifies important characteristics of both sensors and data capture processes, and discusses how semantic and quantitative reasoning can be combined together. This paper also addresses challenges such as efficient distributed sensor search and relational-expression based filtering. CASSARAM testing and performance evaluation results are presented and discussed.</data>

All such solutions will capture large amounts of data pertaining to the environment as well as their users. The IoT's objective is to learn more and better serve system users. Some IoT solutions might store data locally on devices ("things"), whereas others might store it in the cloud. The real value of collecting data comes through data processing and aggregation on a large scale, where new knowledge can be extracted. However, such procedures can lead to user privacy issues.

      <data key="abstract">A disruptive technology that is influencing not only computing paradigm but every other business is the rise of big data. Internet of Things (IoT) applications are considered to be a major source of big data. Such IoT applications are in general supported through clouds where data is stored and processed by big data processing systems. In order to improve the efficiency of cloud infrastructure so that they can efficiently support IoT big data applications, it is important to understand how these applications and the corresponding big data processing systems will perform in cloud computing environments. However, given the scalability and complex requirements of big data processing systems, an empirical evaluation on actual cloud infrastructure can hinder the development of timely and cost effective IoT solutions. Therefore, a simulator supporting IoT applications in cloud environment is highly demanded, but such work is still in its infancy. To fill this gap, we have designed and implemented IOTSim which supports and enables simulation of IoT big data processing using MapReduce model in cloud computing environment.

      <data key="abstract">The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors deployed around us and connected to the Internet, where the mobile crowd sensing technologies are widely used to collect data in different contexts of the IoT paradigm. Due to the popularity of Big Data technologies, processing and storing large volumes of data have become easier than ever. However, large-scale data management tasks still require significant amounts of resources that can be expensive regardless of whether they are purchased or rented (e.g., pay-as-you-go infrastructure). Further, not everyone is interested in such large-scale data collection and analysis. More importantly, not everyone has the financial and computational resources to deal with such large volumes of data. Therefore, a timely need exists for a cloud-integrated mobile crowd sensing platform that is capable of capturing sensors data, on-demand, based on conditions enforced by the data consumers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware, specifically, location and activity-aware mobile sensing platform called context-aware mobile sensor data engine (C-MOSDEN) for the IoT domain. We evaluated the proposed platform using three real-world scenarios that highlight the importance of  selective sensing . The computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform are investigated and are used to highlight the advantages of context-aware selective sensing.</data>
