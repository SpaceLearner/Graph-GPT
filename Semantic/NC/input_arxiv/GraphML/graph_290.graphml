      <data key="title">network function virtualization state of the art and research challenges</data>
      <data key="abstract">Network function virtualization (NFV) has drawn significant attention from both industry and academia as an important shift in telecommunication service provisioning. By decoupling network functions (NFs) from the physical devices on which they run, NFV has the potential to lead to significant reductions in operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expenses (CAPEX) and facilitate the deployment of new services with increased agility and faster time-to-value. The NFV paradigm is still in its infancy and there is a large spectrum of opportunities for the research community to develop new architectures, systems and applications, and to evaluate alternatives and trade-offs in developing technologies for its successful deployment. In this paper, after discussing NFV and its relationship with complementary fields of software defined networking (SDN) and cloud computing, we survey the state-of-the-art in NFV, and identify promising research directions in this area. We also overview key NFV projects, standardization efforts, early implementations, use cases, and commercial products.</data>

      <data key="title">separation framework an enabler for cooperative and d2d communication for future 5g networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Soaring capacity and coverage demands dictate that future cellular networks need to migrate soon toward ultra-dense networks. However, network densification comes with a host of challenges that include compromised energy efficiency, complex interference management, cumbersome mobility management, burdensome signaling overheads, and higher backhaul costs. Interestingly, most of the problems that beleaguer network densification stem from legacy networks' one common feature, i.e., tight coupling between the control and data planes regardless of their degree of heterogeneity and cell density. Consequently, in wake of 5G, control and data planes separation architecture (SARC) has recently been conceived as a promising paradigm that has potential to address most of the aforementioned challenges. In this survey, we review various proposals that have been presented in the literature so far to enable SARC. More specifically, we analyze how and to what degree various SARC proposals address the four main challenges in network densification, namely: energy efficiency, system level capacity maximization, interference management, and mobility management. We then focus on two salient features of future cellular networks that have not yet been adapted in legacy networks at wide scale and thus remain a hallmark of 5G, i.e., coordinated multipoint (CoMP) and device-to-device (D2D) communications. After providing necessary background on CoMP and D2D, we analyze how SARC can particularly act as a major enabler for CoMP and D2D in context of 5G. This article thus serves as both a tutorial as well as an up-to-date survey on SARC, CoMP, and D2D. Most importantly, this survey provides an extensive outlook of challenges and opportunities that lie at the crossroads of these three mutually entangled emerging technologies.</data>

      <data key="title">literally above the clouds virtualizing the network over multiple clouds</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recent SDN-based solutions give cloud providers the opportunity to extend their "as-a-service" model with the offer of complete network virtualization. They provide tenants with the freedom to specify the network topologies and addressing schemes of their choosing, while guaranteeing the required level of isolation among them. These platforms, however, have been targeting the datacenter of a single cloud provider with full control over the infrastructure. #R##N#This paper extends this concept further by supporting the creation of virtual networks that span across several datacenters, which may belong to distinct cloud providers, while including private facilities owned by the tenant. In order to achieve this, we introduce a new network layer above the existing cloud hypervisors, affording the necessary level of control over the communications while hiding the heterogeneity of the clouds. The benefits of this approach are various, such as enabling finer decisions on where to place the virtual machines (e.g., to fulfill legal requirements), avoiding single points of failure, and potentially decreasing costs. Although our focus in the paper is on architecture design, we also present experimental results of a first prototype of the proposed solution.</data>

      <data key="title">secure virtual network embedding in a multi cloud environment</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recently-proposed virtualization platforms give cloud users the freedom to specify their network topologies and addressing schemes. These platforms have, however, been targeting a single datacenter of a cloud provider, which is insufficient to support (critical) applications that need to be deployed across multiple trust domains while enforcing diverse security requirements. This paper addresses this problem by presenting a novel solution for a central component of network virtualization -- the online network embedding, which finds efficient mappings of virtual networks requests onto the substrate network. Our solution considers security as a first class citizen, enabling the definition of flexible policies in three central areas: on the communications, where alternative security compromises can be explored (e.g., encryption); on the computations, supporting redundancy if necessary while capitalizing on hardware assisted trusted executions; across multiples clouds, including public and private facilities, with the associated trust levels. We formulate the solution as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), and evaluate our proposal against the most commonly used alternative. Our analysis gives insight into the trade-offs involved with the inclusion of security and trust into network virtualization, providing evidence that this notion may enhance profits under the appropriate cost models.</data>

      <data key="title">software defined networking based crypto ransomware detection using http traffic characteristics</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   Ransomware is currently one of the key threats facing individuals and corporate Internet users. Especially dangerous is crypto ransomware that encrypts important user data, and it is only possible to recover it once a ransom has been paid. Therefore, devising efficient and effective countermeasures is a pressing necessity. In this paper we present a novel Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based detection approach that utilizes the characteristics of the ransomware communication. Based on an observation of network communication between two crypto ransomware families, namely CryptoWall and Locky, we conclude that an analysis of the HTTP message sequences and their respective content sizes is enough to detect such threats. We show the feasibility of our approach by designing and evaluating a proof-of-concept SDN-based detection system. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient.</data>

      <data key="title">mobile edge computing fog et al a survey and analysis of security threats and challenges</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   For various reasons, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet certain requirements (e.g. low latency and jitter, context awareness, mobility support) that are crucial for several applications (e.g. vehicular networks, augmented reality). To fulfill these requirements, various paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and mobile cloud computing, have emerged in recent years. While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalized; no synergies have been explored. This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others. The main goal of this study is to holistically analyze the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration. In our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms.</data>

      <data key="abstract">BGP/MPLS IP VPN and VPLS services are considered to be widely used in IP/MPLS networks for connecting customers' remote sites. However, service providers struggle with many challenges to provide these services. Management complexity, equipment costs, and last but not least, scalability issues emerging as the customers increase in number, are just some of these problems. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that can solve aforementioned issues using a logically centralized controller for network devices. In this paper, we propose a SDN-based solution called SDxVPN which considerably lowers the complexity of VPN service definition and management. Our method eliminates complex and costly device interactions that used to be done through several control plane protocols and enables customers to determine their service specifications, define restriction policies and even interconnect with other customers automatically without operator's intervention. We describe our prototype implementation of SDxVPN and its scalability evaluations under several representative scenarios. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for deployment to provide large scale VPN services.</data>

      <data key="title">security and privacy issues of big data</data>
      <data key="abstract">This chapter revises the most important aspects in how computing infrastructures should be configured and intelligently managed to fulfill the most notably security aspects required by Big Data applications. One of them is privacy. It is a pertinent aspect to be addressed because users share more and more personal data and content through their devices and computers to social networks and public clouds. So, a secure framework to social networks is a very hot topic research. This last topic is addressed in one of the two sections of the current chapter with case studies. In addition, the traditional mechanisms to support security such as firewalls and demilitarized zones are not suitable to be applied in computing systems to support Big Data. SDN is an emergent management solution that could become a convenient mechanism to implement security in Big Data systems, as we show through a second case study at the end of the chapter. This also discusses current relevant work and identifies open issues.</data>

      <data key="title">knowledge defined networking</data>
      <data key="abstract">The research community has considered in the past the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to control and operate networks. A notable example is the Knowledge Plane proposed by D.Clark et al. However, such techniques have not been extensively prototyped or deployed in the field yet. In this paper, we explore the reasons for the lack of adoption and posit that the rise of two recent paradigms: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Analytics (NA), will facilitate the adoption of AI techniques in the context of network operation and control. We describe a new paradigm that accommodates and exploits SDN, NA and AI, and provide use-cases that illustrate its applicability and benefits. We also present simple experimental results that support, for some relevant use-cases, its feasibility. We refer to this new paradigm as Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN).</data>

      <data key="title">software defined networking a comprehensive survey</data>
      <data key="abstract">Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound APIs, network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms -- with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security and dependability -- as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.</data>

      <data key="title">on orchestrating virtual network functions in nfv</data>
      <data key="abstract">Middleboxes or network appliances like firewalls, proxies and WAN optimizers have become an integral part of today's ISP and enterprise networks. Middlebox functionalities are usually deployed on expensive and proprietary hardware that require trained personnel for deployment and maintenance. Middleboxes contribute significantly to a network's capital and operational costs. In addition, organizations often require their traffic to pass through a specific sequence of middleboxes for compliance with security and performance policies. This makes the middlebox deployment and maintenance tasks even more complicated. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging and promising technology that is envisioned to overcome these challenges. It proposes to move packet processing from dedicated hardware middleboxes to software running on commodity servers. In NFV terminology, software middleboxes are referred to as Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs). It is a challenging problem to determine the required number and placement of VNFs that optimizes network operational costs and utilization, without violating service level agreements. We call this the VNF Orchestration Problem (VNF-OP) and provide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation with implementation in CPLEX. We also provide a dynamic programming based heuristic to solve larger instances of VNF-OP. Trace driven simulations on real-world network topologies demonstrate that the heuristic can provide solutions that are within 1.3 times of the optimal solution. Our experiments suggest that a VNF based approach can provide more than 4x reduction in the operational cost of a network.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Currently, different forms of ransomware are increasingly threatening Internet users. Modern ransomware encrypts important user data, and it is only possible to recover it once a ransom has been paid. In this article we show how software-defined networking can be utilized to improve ransomware mitigation. In more detail, we analyze the behavior of popular ransomware — CryptoWall — and, based on this knowledge, propose two real-time mitigation methods. Then we describe the design of an SDN-based system, implemented using OpenFlow, that facilitates a timely reaction to this threat, and is a crucial factor in the case of crypto ransomware. What is important is that such a design does not significantly affect overall network performance. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The evolution of software defined networking (SDN) has played a significant role in the development of next-generation networks (NGN). SDN as a programmable network having "service provisioning on the fly" has induced a keen interest both in academic world and industry. In this article, a comprehensive survey is presented on SDN advancement over conventional network. The paper covers historical evolution in relation to SDN, functional architecture of the SDN and its related technologies, and OpenFlow standards/protocols, including the basic concept of interfacing of OpenFlow with network elements (NEs) such as optical switches. In addition a selective architecture survey has been conducted. Our proposed architecture on software defined heterogeneous network, points towards new technology enabling the opening of new vistas in the domain of network technology, which will facilitate in handling of huge internet traffic and helps infrastructure and service providers to customize their resources dynamically. Besides, current research projects and various activities as being carried out to standardize SDN as NGN by different standard development organizations (SODs) have been duly elaborated to judge how this technology moves towards standardization.</data>

Mantoo includes an extensible Web-based graphical topology designer, which provides different layered network “views” (e.g., from physical links to service relationships among nodes). The suite can validate an input topology, automatically deploy it over a Mininet emulator or a distributed SDN testbed and allows access to emulated nodes by opening consoles in the web GUI.

      <data key="abstract">To meet the ever-growing demand for a higher communicating rate and better communication quality, more and more small cells are overlaid under the macro base station (MBS) tier, thus forming the heterogeneous networks. Small cells can ease the load pressure of MBS but lack of the guarantee of performance. On the other hand, cooperation draws more and more attention because of the great potential of small cell densification. Some technologies matured in wired network can also be applied to cellular networks, such as software-defined networking (SDN). SDN helps simplify the structure of multi-tier networks. In addition, it is more reasonable for the SDN controller to implement cell coordination. In this paper, we propose a method to offload users from MBSs through small cell cooperation in heterogeneous networks. Association probability is the main indicator of offloading. By using the tools from stochastic geometry, we then obtain the coverage probabilities when users are associated with different types of BSs. All the cell association and cooperation are conducted by the SDN controller. Then, on this basis, we compare the overall coverage probabilities, achievable rate, and energy efficiency with and without cooperation. Numerical results show that small cell cooperation can offload more users from MBS tier. It can also increase the system’s coverage performance. As small cells become denser, cooperation can bring more gains to the energy efficiency of the network.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The emerging software defined networking (SDN) paradigm separates the data plane from the control plane and centralizes network control in an SDN controller. Applications interact with controllers to implement network services, such as network transport with quality of service. SDN facilitates the virtualization of network functions so that multiple virtual networks can operate over a given installed physical network infrastructure. Due to the specific characteristics of optical (photonic) communication components and the high optical transmission capacities, SDN-based optical networking poses particular challenges, but holds also great potential. In this article, we comprehensively survey studies that examine the SDN paradigm in optical networks; in brief, we survey the area of software defined optical networks (SDONs). We mainly organize the SDON studies into studies focused on the infrastructure layer, the control layer, and the application layer. Moreover, we cover SDON studies focused on network virtualization, as well as SDON studies focused on the orchestration of multilayer and multidomain networking. Based on the survey, we identify open challenges for SDONs and outline future directions.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In forthcoming years, the Internet of Things (IoT) will connect billions of smart devices generating and uploading a deluge of data to the cloud. If successfully extracted, the knowledge buried in the data can significantly improve the quality of life and foster economic growth. However, a critical bottleneck for realizing the efficient IoT is the pressure it puts on the existing communication infrastructures, requiring transfer of enormous data volumes. Aiming at addressing this problem, we propose a novel architecture dubbed Condense which integrates the IoT-communication infrastructure into the data analysis. This is achieved via the generic concept of network function computation. Instead of merely transferring data from the IoT sources to the cloud, the communication infrastructure should actively participate in the data analysis by carefully designed en-route processing. We define the Condense architecture, its basic layers, and the interactions among its constituent modules. Furthermore, from the implementation side, we describe how Condense can be integrated into the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) machine type communications (MTCs) architecture, as well as the prospects of making it a practically viable technology in a short time frame, relying on network function virtualization and software-defined networking. Finally, from the theoretical side, we survey the relevant literature on computing atomic functions in both analog and digital domains, as well as on function decomposition over networks, highlighting challenges, insights, and future directions for exploiting these techniques within practical 3GPP MTC architecture.</data>

      <data key="title">survey on network virtualization hypervisors for software defined networking</data>
      <data key="abstract">Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a promising paradigm for making the control of communication networks flexible. SDN separates the data packet forwarding plane, i.e., the data plane, from the control plane and employs a central controller. Network virtualization allows the flexible sharing of physical networking resources by multiple users (tenants). Each tenant runs its own applications over its virtual network, i.e., its slice of the actual physical network. The virtualization of SDN networks promises to allow networks to leverage the combined benefits of SDN networking and network virtualization and has therefore attracted significant research attention in recent years. A critical component for virtualizing SDN networks is an SDN hypervisor that abstracts the underlying physical SDN network into multiple logically isolated virtual SDN networks (vSDNs), each with its own controller. We comprehensively survey hypervisors for SDN networks in this paper. We categorize the SDN hypervisors according to their architecture into centralized and distributed hypervisors. We furthermore sub-classify the hypervisors according to their execution platform into hypervisors running exclusively on general-purpose compute platforms, or on a combination of general-purpose compute platforms with general- or special-purpose network elements. We exhaustively compare the network attribute abstraction and isolation features of the existing SDN hypervisors. As part of the future research agenda, we outline the development of a performance evaluation framework for SDN hypervisors.</data>
