      <data key="title">scaling up mimo opportunities and challenges with very large arrays</data>
      <data key="abstract">Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is maturing and is being incorporated into emerging wireless broadband standards like long-term evolution (LTE) [1]. For example, the LTE standard allows for up to eight antenna ports at the base station. Basically, the more antennas the transmitter/receiver is equipped with, and the more degrees of freedom that the propagation channel can provide, the better the performance in terms of data rate or link reliability. More precisely, on a quasi static channel where a code word spans across only one time and frequency coherence interval, the reliability of a point-to-point MIMO link scales according to Prob(link outage) ` SNR-ntnr where nt and nr are the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively, and signal-to-noise ratio is denoted by SNR. On a channel that varies rapidly as a function of time and frequency, and where circumstances permit coding across many channel coherence intervals, the achievable rate scales as min(nt, nr) log(1 + SNR). The gains in multiuser systems are even more impressive, because such systems offer the possibility to transmit simultaneously to several users and the flexibility to select what users to schedule for reception at any given point in time [2].</data>

      <data key="title">joint sensing and power allocation in nonconvex cognitive radio games quasi nash equilibria</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we propose a novel class of Nash problems for Cognitive Radio (CR) networks composed of multiple primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) wherein each SU (player) competes against the others to maximize his own opportunistic throughput by choosing jointly the sensing duration, the detection thresholds, and the vector power allocation over a multichannel link. In addition to power budget constraints, several (deterministic or probabilistic) interference constraints can be accommodated in the proposed general formulation, such as constraints on the maximum individual/aggregate (probabilistic) interference tolerable from the PUs. To keep the optimization as decentralized as possible, global interference constraints, when present, are imposed via pricing; the prices are thus additional variables to be optimized. The resulting players' optimization problems are nonconvex and there are price clearance conditions associated with the nonconvex global interference constraints to be satisfied by the equilibria of the game, which make the analysis of the proposed game a challenging task; none of classical results in the game theory literature can be successfully applied. To deal with the nonconvexity of the game, we introduce a relaxed equilibrium concept - the Quasi-Nash Equilibrium (QNE)- and study its main properties, performance, and connection with local Nash equilibria. Quite interestingly, the proposed game theoretical formulations yield a considerable performance improvement with respect to current centralized and decentralized designs of CR systems, which validates the concept of QNE.</data>

      <data key="title">reconfigurable wireless networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Driven by the advent of sophisticated and ubiquitous applications, and the ever-growing need for information, wireless networks are without a doubt steadily evolving into profoundly more complex and dynamic systems. The user demands are progressively rampant, while application requirements continue to expand in both range and diversity. Future wireless networks, therefore, must be equipped with the ability to handle numerous, albeit challenging, requirements. Network reconfiguration, considered as a prominent network paradigm, is envisioned to play a key role in leveraging future network performance and considerably advancing current user experiences. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of reconfigurable wireless networks and an in-depth analysis of reconfiguration at all layers of the protocol stack. Such networks characteristically possess the ability to reconfigure and adapt their hardware and software components and architectures, thus enabling flexible delivery of broad services, as well as sustaining robust operation under highly dynamic conditions. The paper offers a unifying framework for research in reconfigurable wireless networks. This should provide the reader with a holistic view of concepts, methods, and strategies in reconfigurable wireless networks. Focus is given to reconfigurable systems in relatively new and emerging research areas such as cognitive radio networks, cross-layer reconfiguration, and software-defined networks. In addition, modern networks have to be intelligent and capable of self-organization. Thus, this paper discusses the concept of network intelligence as a means to enable reconfiguration in highly complex and dynamic networks. Key processes in network intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and context awareness, are presented to illustrate how these methods can take reconfiguration to a new level. Finally, the paper is supported with several examples and case studies showing the tremendous impact of reconfiguration on wireless networks.</data>

      <data key="title">spectrum sensing in cognitive radios based on multiple cyclic frequencies</data>
      <data key="abstract">Cognitive radios sense the radio spectrum in order to find unused frequency bands and use them in an agile manner. Transmission by the primary user must be detected reliably even in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and in the face of shadowing and fading. Communication signals are typically cyclostationary, and have many periodic statistical properties related to the symbol rate, the coding and modulation schemes as well as the guard periods, for example. These properties can be exploited in designing a detector, and for distinguishing between the primary and secondary users' signals. In this paper, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for detecting the presence of cyclostationarity using multiple cyclic frequencies is proposed. Distributed decision making is employed by combining the quantized local test statistics from many secondary users. User cooperation allows for mitigating the effects of shadowing and provides a larger footprint for the cognitive radio system. Simulation examples demonstrate the resulting performance gains in the low SNR regime and the benefits of cooperative detection.</data>

      <data key="title">multiband spectrum access great promises for future cognitive radio networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Cognitive radio has been widely considered as one of the prominent solutions to tackle the spectrum scarcity. While the majority of existing research has focused on single-band cognitive radio, multiband cognitive radio represents great promises toward implementing efficient cognitive networks compared to single-based networks. Multiband cognitive radio networks (MB-CRNs) are expected to significantly enhance the network's throughput and provide better channel maintenance by reducing handoff frequency. Nevertheless, the wideband front-end and the multiband spectrum access impose a number of challenges yet to overcome. This paper provides an in-depth analysis on the recent advancements in multiband spectrum sensing techniques, their limitations, and possible future directions to improve them. We study cooperative communications for MB-CRNs to tackle a fundamental limit on diversity and sampling. We also investigate several limits and tradeoffs of various design parameters for MB-CRNs. In addition, we explore the key MB-CRNs performance metrics that differ from the conventional metrics used for single-band-based networks.</data>

      <data key="title">energy efficiency of distributed signal processing in wireless networks a cross layer analysis</data>
      <data key="abstract">In order to meet the growing mobile data demand, future wireless networks will be equipped with a mulitude of access points (APs). Besides the important implications for the energy consumption, the trend towards densification requires the development of decentralized and sustainable radio resource management techniques. It is critically important to understand how the distribution of signal processing operations affects the energy efficiency of wireless networks. In this paper, we provide a cross-layer framework to evaluate and compare the energy efficiency of wireless networks under different levels of distribution of the signal processing load: 1) hybrid, where the signal processing operations are shared between nodes and APs; 2) centralized, where signal processing is entirely implemented at the APs; and 3) fully distributed, where all operations are performed by the nodes. We find that in practical wireless networks, hybrid signal processing exhibits a significant energy efficiency gain over both centralized and fully distributed approaches.</data>

      <data key="title">coverage and rate analysis for millimeter wave cellular networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Millimeter wave (mmWave) holds promise as a carrier frequency for fifth generation cellular networks. Because mmWave signals are sensitive to blockage, prior models for cellular networks operated in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band do not apply to analyze mmWave cellular networks directly. Leveraging concepts from stochastic geometry, this paper proposes a general framework to evaluate the coverage and rate performance in mmWave cellular networks. Using a distance-dependent line-of-site (LOS) probability function, the locations of the LOS and non-LOS base stations are modeled as two independent non-homogeneous Poisson point processes, to which different path loss laws are applied. Based on the proposed framework, expressions for the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) and rate coverage probability are derived. The mmWave coverage and rate performance are examined as a function of the antenna geometry and base station density. The case of dense networks is further analyzed by applying a simplified system model, in which the LOS region of a user is approximated as a fixed LOS ball. The results show that dense mmWave networks can achieve comparable coverage and much higher data rates than conventional UHF cellular systems, despite the presence of blockages. The results suggest that the cell size to achieve the optimal SINR scales with the average size of the area that is LOS to a user.</data>

      <data key="title">random interruptions in cooperation for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, a new cooperation structure for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks is proposed which outperforms the existing commonly-used ones in terms of energy efficiency. The efficiency is achieved in the proposed design by introducing random interruptions in the cooperation process between the sensing nodes and the fusion center, along with a compensation process at the fusion center. Regarding the hypothesis testing problem concerned, first, the proposed system behavior is thoroughly analyzed and its associated likelihood-ratio test (LRT) is provided. Next, based on a general linear fusion rule, statistics of the global test summary are derived and the sensing quality is characterized in terms of the probability of false alarm and the probability of detection. Then, optimization of the overall detection performance is formulated according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion (NPC) and it is discussed that the optimization required is indeed a decision-making process with uncertainty which incurs prohibitive computational complexity. The NPC is then modified to achieve a good affordable solution by using semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques and it is shown that this new solution is nearly optimal according to the deflection criterion. Finally, effectiveness of the proposed architecture and its associated SDP are demonstrated by simulation results.</data>

      <data key="title">achieving autonomous compressive spectrum sensing for cognitive radios</data>
      <data key="abstract">Compressive sensing (CS) technologies present many advantages over other existing approaches for implementing wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radios (CRs), such as reduced sampling rate and computational complexity. However, there are two significant challenges: 1) choosing an appropriate number of sub-Nyquist measurements and 2) deciding when to terminate the greedy recovery algorithm that reconstructs wideband spectrum. In this paper, an autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that enables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while guaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery error. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the validation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with high confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and noisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery (SASR) algorithm is proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the instantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap between CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that ACSS not only can recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of measurements but can considerably improve the spectral recovery performance as well, compared with existing CS approaches. The proposed recovery algorithm can autonomously adopt a proper number of iterations, therefore solving the problems of underfitting or overfitting, which commonly exist in most greedy recovery algorithms.</data>

      <data key="title">optimal multiband joint detection for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Spectrum sensing is an essential functionality that enables cognitive radios to detect spectral holes and to opportunistically use under-utilized frequency bands without causing harmful interference to legacy (primary) networks. In this paper, a novel wideband spectrum sensing technique referred to as multiband joint detection is introduced, which jointly detects the primary signals over multiple frequency bands rather than over one band at a time. Specifically, the spectrum sensing problem is formulated as a class of optimization problems, which maximize the aggregated opportunistic throughput of a cognitive radio system under some constraints on the interference to the primary users. By exploiting the hidden convexity in the seemingly nonconvex problems, optimal solutions can be obtained for multiband joint detection under practical conditions. The situation in which individual cognitive radios might not be able to reliably detect weak primary signals due to channel fading/shadowing is also considered. To address this issue by exploiting the spatial diversity, a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme refereed to as spatial-spectral joint detection is proposed, which is based on a linear combination of the local statistics from multiple spatially distributed cognitive radios. The cooperative sensing problem is also mapped into an optimization problem, for which suboptimal solutions can be obtained through mathematical transformation under conditions of practical interest. Simulation results show that the proposed spectrum sensing schemes can considerably improve system performance. This paper establishes useful principles for the design of distributed wideband spectrum sensing algorithms in cognitive radio networks.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The surest way to increase the system capacity of a wireless link is by getting the transmitter and receiver closer to each other, which creates the dual benefits of higher-quality links and more spatial reuse. In a network with nomadic users, this inevitably involves deploying more infrastructure, typically in the form of microcells, hot spots, distributed antennas, or relays. A less expensive alternative is the recent concept of femtocells - also called home base stations - which are data access points installed by home users to get better indoor voice and data coverage. In this article we overview the technical and business arguments for femtocells and describe the state of the art on each front. We also describe the technical challenges facing femtocell networks and give some preliminary ideas for how to overcome them.</data>

      <data key="title">general spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">The successful operation of cognitive radio (CR) between CR transmitter and CR receiver (CR link) relies on reliable spectrum sensing. To network CRs requires spectrum sensing at CR transmitter and further information regarding the spectrum availability at CR receiver. Redefining the spectrum sensing along with statistical inference suitable for cognitive radio networks (CRN), we mathematically derive conditions to allow CR transmitter forwarding packets to CR receiver under guaranteed outage probability, and prove that the correlation of localized spectrum availability between a cooperative node and CR receiver determines effectiveness of the cooperative scheme. Applying our novel mathematical model to potential hidden terminals in CRN, we illustrate that the allowable transmission region of a CR, defined as neighborhood, is no longer circular shape even in a pure path loss channel model. This results in asymmetric CR links to make bidirectional links generally inappropriate in CRN, though this challenge can be alleviated by cooperative sensing. Therefore, spectrum sensing capability determines CRN topology. For multiple cooperative nodes, to fully utilize spectrum availability, the selection methodology of cooperative nodes is developed due to limited overhead of information exchange. Defining reliability as information of spectrum availability at CR receiver provided by a cooperative node and by applying neighborhood area, we can compare sensing capability of cooperative nodes from both link and network perspectives. In addition, due to lack of centralized coordination in dynamic CRN, CRs can only acquire local and partial information within limited sensing duration, robust spectrum sensing is therefore proposed. Limits of cooperative schemes and their impacts on network operation are also derived.</data>

      <data key="title">multi rate sub nyquist spectrum sensing in cognitive radios</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wideband spectrum sensing is becoming increasingly important to cognitive radio (CR) systems for exploiting spectral opportunities. This paper introduces a novel multi-rate sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing (MS3) system that implements cooperative wideband spectrum sensing in a CR network. MS3 can detect the wideband spectrum using partial measurements without reconstructing the full frequency spectrum. Sub-Nyquist sampling rates are adopted in sampling channels for wrapping the frequency spectrum onto itself. This significantly reduces sensing requirements of CR. The effects of sub-Nyquist sampling are considered, and the performance of multi-channel sub-Nyquist samplings is analyzed. To improve its detection performance, sub-Nyquist sampling rates are chosen to be different such that the numbers of samples are consecutive prime numbers. Furthermore, when the received signals at CRs are faded or shadowed, the performance of MS3 is analytically evaluated. Numerical results show that the proposed system can significantly enhance the wideband spectrum sensing performance while requiring low computational and implementation complexities.</data>

      <data key="title">spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks performance evaluation and optimization</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper studies cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks where secondary users collect local energy statistics and report their findings to a secondary base station, i.e., a fusion center. First, the average error probability is quantitively analyzed to capture the dynamic nature of both observation and fusion channels, assuming fixed amplifier gains for relaying local statistics to the fusion center. Second, the system level overhead of cooperative spectrum sensing is addressed by considering both the local processing cost and the transmission cost. Local processing cost incorporates the overhead of sample collection and energy calculation that must be conducted by each secondary user; the transmission cost accounts for the overhead of forwarding the energy statistic computed at each secondary user to the fusion center. Results show that when jointly designing the number of collected energy samples and transmission amplifier gains, only one secondary user needs to be actively engaged in spectrum sensing. Furthermore, when number of energy samples or amplifier gains are fixed, closed form expressions for optimal solutions are derived and a generalized water-filling algorithm is provided.</data>

      <data key="title">millimeter wave cellular wireless networks potentials and challenges</data>
      <data key="abstract">Millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz are a new frontier for cellular communication that offers the promise of orders of magnitude greater bandwidths combined with further gains via beamforming and spatial multiplexing from multielement antenna arrays. This paper surveys measurements and capacity studies to assess this technology with a focus on small cell deployments in urban environments. The conclusions are extremely encouraging; measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that, even in an urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor, street-level coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential low-power microcell or picocell base station. In addition, based on statistical channel models from these measurements, it is shown that mmW systems can offer more than an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks at current cell densities. Cellular systems, however, will need to be significantly redesigned to fully achieve these gains. Specifically, the requirement of highly directional and adaptive transmissions, directional isolation between links, and significant possibilities of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel structure, synchronization, and receiver design. To address these challenges, the paper discusses how various technologies including adaptive beamforming, multihop relaying, heterogeneous network architectures, and carrier aggregation can be leveraged in the mmW context.</data>

      <data key="title">spectrum sensing by cognitive radios at very low snr</data>
      <data key="abstract">Spectrum sensing is one of the enabling functionalities for cognitive radio (CR) systems to operate in the spectrum white space. To protect the primary incumbent users from interference, the CR is required to detect incumbent signals at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we present a spectrum sensing technique based on correlating spectra for detection of television (TV) broadcasting signals. The basic strategy is to correlate the periodogram of the received signal with the a priori known spectral features of the primary signal. We show that according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion, this spectra correlation-based sensing technique is asymptotically optimal at very low SNR and with a large sensing time. From the system design perspective, we analyze the effect of the spectral features on the spectrum sensing performance. Through the optimization analysis, we obtain useful insights on how to choose effective spectral features to achieve reliable sensing. Simulation results show that the proposed sensing technique can reliably detect analog and digital TV signals at SNR as low as -20 dB.</data>

With the advent of cloud computing, many ecosystem and business paradigms are encountering potential changes and may be able to eliminate their IT infrastructure maintenance processes. Real-time performance and high availability requirements have induced telecom networks to adopt the new concepts of the cloud model: software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). NFV introduces and deploys new network functions in an open and standardized IT environment, while SDN aims to transform the way networks function. SDN and NFV are complementary technologies; they do not depend on each other. However, both concepts can be merged and have the potential to mitigate the challenges of legacy networks. In this paper, our aim is to describe the benefits of using SDN in a multitude of environments such as in data centers, data center networks, and Network as Service offerings. We also present the various challenges facing SDN, from scalability to reliability and security concerns, and discuss existing solutions to these challenges.</data>

We then propose constant-factor polynomial-time approximation algorithms and demonstrate their superior performance via simulations.</data>
