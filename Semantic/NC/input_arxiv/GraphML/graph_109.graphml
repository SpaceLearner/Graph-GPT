      <data key="abstract">Let S be a unital ring and sigma a ring automorphism of S. We construct unital nonassociative algebras out of the twisted polynomial ring S[t;sigma] and polynomials f(t) in S[t;sigma], whose leading coefficient is a unit. If S is a commutative finite chain ring, these algebras yield examples of generalized Galois rings and can be employed to construct linear codes over commutative finite chain rings.</data>

      <data key="title">information bit error rate and false positives in an mds code</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, a computation of the input-redundancy weight enumerator is presented. This is used to improve the theoretical approximation of the information--bit error rate, in terms of the channel bit--error rate, in a block transmission through a discrete memoryless channel. Since a bounded distance reproducing encoder is assumed, we introduce the here-called false positive, a decoding failure with no information-symbol error, and we estimate the probability that this event occurs. As a consequence, a new performance analysis of an MDS code is proposed.</data>

      <data key="title">on the construction of skew quasi cyclic codes</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper we study a special type of quasi-cyclic (QC) codes called skew QC codes. This set of codes is constructed using a non-commutative ring called the skew polynomial rings $F[x;\theta ]$. After a brief description of the skew polynomial ring $F[x;\theta ]$ it is shown that skew QC codes are left submodules of the ring $R_{s}^{l}=(F[x;\theta ]/(x^{s}-1))^{l}.$ The notions of generator and parity-check polynomials are given. We also introduce the notion of similar polynomials in the ring $F[x;\theta ]$ and show that parity-check polynomials for skew QC codes are unique up to similarity. Our search results lead to the construction of several new codes with Hamming distances exceeding the Hamming distances of the previously best known linear codes with comparable parameters.</data>

      <data key="title">ideal codes over separable ring extensions</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper investigates the application of the theoretical algebraic notion of a separable ring extension, in the realm of cyclic convolutional codes or, more generally, ideal codes. We work under very mild conditions, that cover all previously known as well as new non trivial examples. It is proved that ideal codes are direct summands as left ideals of the underlying non-commutative algebra, in analogy with cyclic block codes. This implies, in particular, that they are generated by an idempotent element. Hence, by using a suitable separability element, we design an efficient algorithm for computing one of such idempotents.</data>

      <data key="title">skew polynomial rings and skew cyclic codes</data>
      <data key="abstract">This is a survey on the theory of skew-cyclic codes based on skew-polynomial rings of automorphism type. Skew-polynomial rings have been introduced and discussed by Ore (1933). Evaluation of skew polynomials and sets of (right) roots were first considered by Lam (1986) and studied in great detail by Lam and Leroy thereafter. After a detailed presentation of the most relevant properties of skew polynomials, we survey the algebraic theory of skew-cyclic codes as introduced by Boucher and Ulmer (2007) and studied by many authors thereafter. A crucial role will be played by skew-circulant matrices. Finally, skew-cyclic codes with designed minimum distance are discussed, and we report on two different kinds of skew-BCH codes, which were designed in 2014 and later.</data>

      <data key="title">matroidal structure of skew polynomial rings with application to network coding</data>
      <data key="abstract">Over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, the evaluation of skew polynomials is intimately related to the evaluation of linearized polynomials. This connection allows one to relate the concept of polynomial independence defined for skew polynomials to the familiar concept of linear independence for vector spaces. This relation allows for the definition of a representable matroid called the $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}[x;\sigma]$-matroid, with rank function that makes it a metric space. Specific submatroids of this matroid are individually bijectively isometric to the projective geometry of $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ equipped with the subspace metric. This isometry allows one to use the $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}[x;\sigma]$-matroid in a matroidal network coding application.</data>

In this paper, we deal with linear codes of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ invariant under a semi-linear map $T:\mathbb{F}_q^n\to\mathbb{F}_q^n$ for some $n\geq 2$. In particular, we study three kind of their dual codes, some relations between them and we focus on codes which are products of module skew codes in the non-commutative polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[X,\theta]$ as a subcase of linear codes invariant by a semi-linear map $T$. In this setting we give also an algorithm for encoding, decoding and detecting errors and we show a method to construct codes invariant under a fixed $T$.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We show how cyclic (f,sigma,delta)-codes over finite rings canonically induce a Z-lattice in R^N. The construction can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Construction A for lattices from linear codes and has applications to coset coding, in particular to wire-tap coding. Previous results for lattices obtained from sigma-constacyclic codes by Ducoat and Oggier are obtained as special cases.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Let $F$ be a number field with ring of integers $\Oc_F$ and $\Dc$ a division $F$-algebra with a maximal cyclic subfield $K$. We study rings occurring as quotients of a natural $\Oc_F$-order $\Lambda$ in $\Dc$ by two-sided ideals. We reduce the problem to studying the ideal structure of $\Lambda/\qf^s\Lambda$, where $\qf$ is a prime ideal in $\Oc_F$, $s\geq 1$. We study the case where $\qf$ remains unramified in $K$, both when $s=1$ and $s&gt;1$. This work is motivated by its applications to space-time coded modulation.</data>

      <data key="title">a circulant approach to skew constacyclic codes</data>
      <data key="abstract">We introduce circulant matrices that capture the structure of a skew-polynomial ring F[x;\theta] modulo the left ideal generated by a polynomial of the type x^n-a. This allows us to develop an approach to skew-constacyclic codes based on such circulants. Properties of these circulants are derived, and in particular it is shown that the transpose of a certain circulant is a circulant again. This recovers the well-known result that the dual of a skew-constacyclic code is a constacyclic code again. Special attention is paid to the case where x^n-a is two-sided.</data>

      <data key="title">skew constacyclic codes over finite chain rings</data>
      <data key="abstract">Skew polynomial rings over finite fields ([7] and [10]) and over Galois rings ([8]) have been used to study codes. In this paper, we extend this concept to finite chain rings. Properties of skew constacyclic codes generated by monic right divisors of $x^n-\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is a unit element, are exhibited. When $\lambda^2=1$, the generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes of such codes are determined together with necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual. Of more interest are codes over the ring $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}+u\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. The structure of all skew constacyclic codes is completely determined. This allows us to express generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes of skew cyclic and skew negacyclic codes in terms of the generators of the original codes. An illustration of all skew cyclic codes of length~2 over $\mathbb{F}_{3}+u\mathbb{F}_{3}$ and their Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes is also provided.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We propose a full-rate iterated space-time code construction, to design 2n-dimensional codes from n-dimensional cyclic algebra based codes. We give a condition to determine whether the resulting codes satisfy the full-diversity property, and study their maximum likelihood decoding complexity with respect to sphere decoding. Particular emphasis is given to the cases n = 2, sometimes referred to as MIDO (multiple input double output) codes, and n = 3. In the process, we derive an interesting way of obtaining division algebras, and study their center and maximal subfield.</data>

By the factorization theory of ideals, we give the Chinese Remainder Theorem over the skew polynomial ring, which leads to a canonical decomposition of skew GQC codes.

For a 1-generator skew GQC code, we define the parity-check polynomial, determine the dimension and give a lower bound on the minimum Hamming distance.
