      <data key="title">worst case coalitions in routing games</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recently, there has been a growing interest in network scenarios where selfish agents are able to communicate, bargain and form coalitions, i.e., play a cooperative game, in order to overcome the inefficiency of noncooperative equilibria. We study such coalitional games under worst-case conditions in the fundamental load-balancing setting of routing over parallel links. Specifically, we investigate fundamental solution concepts of the considered cooperative game, namely the (Inner) Core and the min-max fair Nucleolus. Most notably we prove that under certain conditions they contain the system optimum.</data>

      <data key="title">a survey on routing and data dissemination in opportunistic mobile social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Opportunistic mobile social networks (MSNs) are modern paradigms of delay tolerant networks that consist of mobile users with social characteristics. The users in MSNs communicate with each other to share data objects. In this setting, humans are the carriers of mobile devices, hence their social features such as movement patterns, similarities, and interests can be exploited to design efficient data forwarding algorithms. In this paper, an overview of routing and data dissemination issues in the context of opportunistic MSNs is presented, with focus on (1) MSN characteristics, (2) human mobility models, (3) dynamic community detection methods, and (4) routing and data dissemination protocols. Firstly, characteristics of MSNs which lead to the exposure of patterns of interaction among mobile users are examined. Secondly, properties of human mobility models are discussed and recently proposed mobility models are surveyed. Thirdly, community detection and evolution analysis algorithms are investigated. Then, a comparative review of state-of-the-art routing and data dissemination algorithms for MSNs is presented, with special attention paid to critical issues like context-awareness and user selfishness. Based on the literature review, some important open issues are finally discussed.</data>

      <data key="title">social community aware content placement in wireless device to device communication networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, a novel framework for optimizing the caching of popular user content at the level of wireless user equipments (UEs) is proposed. The goal is to improve content offloading over wireless device-to-device (D2D) communication links. In the considered network, users belong to different social communities while their UEs form a single multi-hop D2D network. The proposed framework allows to exploit the multi-community social context of users for improving the local offloading of cached content in a multihop D2D network. To model the collaborative effect of a set of UEs on content offloading, a cooperative game between the UEs is formulated. For this game, it is shown that the Shapley value (SV) of each UE effectively captures the impact of this UE on the overall content offloading process. To capture the presence of multiple social communities that connect the UEs, a hypergraph model is proposed. Two line graphs, an influence-weighted graph, and a connectivity-weighted graph, are developed for analyzing the proposed hypergaph model. Using the developed line graphs along with the SV of the cooperative game, a precise offloading power metric is derived for each UE within a multi-community, multi-hop D2D network. Then, UEs with high offloading power are chosen as the optimal locations for caching the popular content. Simulation results show that, on the average, the proposed cache placement framework achieves 12%, 19%, and 21% improvements in terms of the number of UEs that received offloaded popular content compared to the schemes based on betweenness, degree, and closeness centrality, respectively.</data>

      <data key="title">a packet dropping mechanism for efficient operation of m m 1 queues with selfish users</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   We consider a fundamental game theoretic problem concerning selfish users contributing packets to an M/M/1 queue. In this game, each user controls its own input rate so as to optimize a desired tradeoff between throughput and delay. We first show that the original game has an inefficient Nash Equilibrium (NE), with a Price of Anarchy (PoA) that scales linearly or worse in the number of users. In order to improve the outcome efficiency, we propose an easily implementable mechanism design whereby the server randomly drops packets with a probability that is a function of the total arrival rate. We show that this results in a modified M/M/1 queueing game that is an ordinal potential game with at least one NE. In particular, for a linear packet dropping function, which is similar to the Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm used in Internet Congestion Control, we prove that there is a unique NE. We also show that the simple best response dynamic converges to this unique equilibrium. Finally, for this scheme, we prove that the social welfare (expressed either as the summation of utilities of all players, or as the summation of the logarithm of utilities of all players) at the equilibrium point can be arbitrarily close to the social welfare at the global optimal point, i.e. the PoA can be made arbitrarily close to 1. We also study the impact of arrival rate estimation error on the PoA through simulations.</data>

      <data key="title">coalitional games in partition form for joint spectrum sensing and access in cognitive radio networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Unlicensed secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio networks are subject to an inherent tradeoff between spectrum sensing and spectrum access. Although each SU has an incentive to sense the primary user (PU) channels for locating spectrum holes, this exploration of the spectrum can come at the expense of a shorter transmission time, and, hence, a possibly smaller capacity for data transmission. This paper investigates the impact of this tradeoff on the cooperative strategies of a network of SUs that seek to cooperate in order to improve their view of the spectrum (sensing), reduce the possibility of interference among each other, and improve their transmission capacity (access). The problem is modeled as a coalitional game in partition form and an algorithm for coalition formation is proposed. Using the proposed algorithm, the SUs can make individual distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition while maximizing their utilities which capture the average time spent for sensing as well as the capacity achieved while accessing the spectrum. It is shown that, by using the proposed algorithm, the SUs can self-organize into a network partition composed of disjoint coalitions, with the members of each coalition cooperating to jointly optimize their sensing and access performance. Simulation results show the performance improvement that the proposed algorithm yields with respect to the noncooperative case. The results also show how the algorithm allows the SUs to self-adapt to changes in the environment such as changes in the traffic of the PUs, or slow mobility.</data>

      <data key="title">evolutionary game and learning for dynamic spectrum access</data>
      <data key="abstract">Efficient dynamic spectrum access mechanism is crucial for improving the spectrum utilization. In this paper, we consider the dynamic spectrum access mechanism design with both complete and incomplete network information. When the network information is available, we propose an evolutionary spectrum access mechanism. We use the replicator dynamics to study the dynamics of channel selections, and show that the mechanism achieves an equilibrium that is an evolutionarily stable strategy and is also max-min fair. With incomplete network information, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning mechanism for dynamic spectrum access. Each secondary user applies the maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate its expected payoff based on the local observations, and learns to adjust its mixed strategy for channel selections adaptively over time. We study the convergence of the learning mechanism based on the theory of stochastic approximation, and show that it globally converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium. Numerical results show that the proposed evolutionary spectrum access and distributed reinforcement learning mechanisms achieve up to 82% and 70% performance improvement than a random access mechanism, respectively, and are robust to random perturbations of channel selections.</data>

      <data key="title">coalitional game theory for communication networks a tutorial</data>
      <data key="abstract">Game theoretical techniques have recently become prevalent in many engineering applications, notably in communications. With the emergence of cooperation as a new communication paradigm, and the need for self-organizing, decentralized, and autonomic networks, it has become imperative to seek suitable game theoretical tools that allow to analyze and study the behavior and interactions of the nodes in future communication networks. In this context, this tutorial introduces the concepts of cooperative game theory, namely coalitional games, and their potential applications in communication and wireless networks. For this purpose, we classify coalitional games into three categories: Canonical coalitional games, coalition formation games, and coalitional graph games. This new classification represents an application-oriented approach for understanding and analyzing coalitional games. For each class of coalitional games, we present the fundamental components, introduce the key properties, mathematical techniques, and solution concepts, and describe the methodologies for applying these games in several applications drawn from the state-of-the-art research in communications. In a nutshell, this article constitutes a unified treatment of coalitional game theory tailored to the demands of communications and network engineers.</data>

      <data key="title">cooperative device to device communications with caching</data>
      <data key="abstract">Device-to-Device (D2D) communications can increase the throughput of cellular networks significantly, where the interference among D2D links should be properly managed. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic cooperative D2D transmission strategy by exploiting the caching capability at the users to deal with the interference among D2D links. To increase the cooperative opportunity and improve spatial reuse gain, we divide the D2D users into clusters and cache different popular files at the users within a cluster, and then find the optimal cluster size. To maximize the network throughput, we assign different frequency bands to cooperative and non- cooperative D2D links and optimize the bandwidth partition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can provide 500% -600% throughput gain over existing cache-enabled D2D communications when the popularity distribution is skewed, and can provide 40%-80% gain even when the popularity distribution is uniform.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The problem of finding the $k$ most critical nodes, referred to as the $top\text{-}k$ problem, is a very important one in several contexts such as information diffusion and preference aggregation in social networks, clustering of data points, etc. It has been observed in the literature that the value allotted to a node by most of the popular cooperative game theoretic solution concepts, acts as a good measure of appropriateness of that node (or a data point) to be included in the $top\text{-}k$ set, by itself. However, in general, nodes having the highest $k$ values are not the desirable $top\text{-}k$ nodes, because the appropriateness of a node to be a part of the $top\text{-}k$ set depends on other nodes in the set. As this is not explicitly captured by cooperative game theoretic solution concepts, it is necessary to post-process the obtained values in order to output the suitable $top\text{-}k$ nodes. In this paper, we propose several such post-processing methods and give reasoning behind each of them, and also propose a standalone algorithm that combines cooperative game theoretic solution concepts with the popular greedy hill-climbing algorithm.</data>

      <data key="title">social data offloading in d2d enhanced cellular networks by network formation games</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recently, cellular networks are severely overloaded by social-based services, such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, in which thousands of clients subscribe a common content provider (e.g., a popular singer) and download his/her content updates all the time. Offloading such traffic through complementary networks, such as a delay tolerant network formed by device-to-device (D2D) communications between mobile subscribers, is a promising solution to reduce the cellular burdens. In the existing solutions, mobile users are assumed to be volunteers who selfishlessly deliver the content to every other user in proximity while moving. However, practical users are selfish and they will evaluate their individual payoffs in the D2D sharing process, which may highly influence the network performance compared to the case of selfishless users. In this paper, we take user selfishness into consideration and propose a network formation game to capture the dynamic characteristics of selfish behaviors. In the proposed game, we provide the utility function of each user and specify the conditions under which the subscribers are guaranteed to converge to a stable network. Then, we propose a practical network formation algorithm in which the users can decide their D2D sharing strategies based on their historical records. Simulation results show that user selfishness can highly degrade the efficiency of data offloading, compared with ideal volunteer users. Also, the decrease caused by user selfishness can be highly affected by the cost ratio between the cellular transmission and D2D transmission, the access delays, and mobility patterns.</data>

      <data key="title">context aware small cell networks how social metrics improve wireless resource allocation</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, a novel approach for optimizing and managing resource allocation in wireless small cell networks (SCNs) with device-to-device (D2D) communication is proposed. The proposed approach allows to jointly exploit both the wireless and social context of wireless users for optimizing the overall allocation of resources and improving traffic offload in SCNs. This context-aware resource allocation problem is formulated as a matching game in which user equipments (UEs) and resource blocks (RBs) rank one another, based on utility functions that capture both wireless and social metrics. Due to social interrelations, this game is shown to belong to a class of matching games with peer effects. To solve this game, a novel, selforganizing algorithm is proposed, using which UEs and RBs can interact to decide on their desired allocation. The proposed algorithm is then proven to converge to a two-sided stable matching between UEs and RBs. The properties of the resulting stable outcome are then studied and assessed. Simulation results using real social data show that clustering of socially connected users allows to offload a substantially larger amount of traffic than the conventional context-unaware approach. These results show that exploiting social context has high practical relevance in saving resources on the wireless links and on the backhaul.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we approach the classical problem of clustering using solution concepts from cooperative game theory such as Nucleolus and Shapley value. We formulate the problem of clustering as a characteristic form game and develop a novel algorithm DRAC (Density-Restricted Agglomerative Clustering) for clustering. With extensive experimentation on standard data sets, we compare the performance of DRAC with that of well known algorithms. We show an interesting result that four prominent solution concepts, Nucleolus, Shapley value, Gately point and \tau-value coincide for the defined characteristic form game. This vindicates the choice of the characteristic function of the clustering game and also provides strong intuitive foundation for our approach.</data>

      <data key="title">de anonymization of social networks with communities when quantifications meet algorithms</data>
      <data key="abstract">A crucial privacy-driven issue nowadays is re-identifying anonymized social networks by mapping them to correlated cross-domain auxiliary networks. Prior works are typically based on modeling social networks as random graphs representing users and their relations, and subsequently quantify the quality of mappings through cost functions that are proposed without sufficient rationale. Also, it remains unknown how to algorithmically meet the demand of such quantifications, i.e., to find the minimizer of the cost functions. We address those concerns in a more realistic social network modeling parameterized by community structures that can be leveraged as side information for de-anonymization. By Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, our first contribution is new and well justified cost functions, which, when minimized, enjoy superiority to previous ones in finding the correct mapping with the highest probability. The feasibility of the cost functions is then for the first time algorithmically characterized. While proving the general multiplicative inapproximability, we are able to propose two algorithms, which, respectively, enjoy an \epsilon-additive approximation and a conditional optimality in carrying out successful user re-identification. Our theoretical findings are empirically validated, with a notable dataset extracted from rare true cross-domain networks that reproduce genuine social network de-anonymization. Both theoretical and empirical observations also manifest the importance of community information in enhancing privacy inferencing.</data>

      <data key="title">coalitional games in miso interference channels epsilon core and coalition structure stable set</data>
      <data key="abstract">The multiple-input single-output interference channel is considered. Each transmitter is assumed to know the channels between itself and all receivers perfectly and the receivers are assumed to treat interference as additive noise. In this setting, noncooperative transmission does not take into account the interference generated at other receivers which generally leads to inefficient performance of the links. To improve this situation, we study cooperation between the links using coalitional games. The players ( links) in a coalition either perform zero forcing transmission or Wiener filter precoding to each other. The epsilon-core is a solution concept for coalitional games that takes into account the overhead required in coalition deviation. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong and weak epsilon-core of our coalitional game not to be empty with zero forcing transmission. Since, the epsilon-core only considers the possibility of joint cooperation of all links, we study coalitional games in partition form in which several distinct coalitions can form. We propose a polynomial-time distributed coalition formation algorithm based on coalition merging and prove that its solution lies in the coalition structure stable set of our coalition formation game. Simulation results reveal the cooperation gains for different coalition formation complexities and deviation overhead models.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Device-to-device (D2D) communications was initially proposed in cellular networks as a new paradigm for enhancing network performance. The emergence of new applications such as content distribution and location-aware advertisement introduced new user cases for D2D communications in cellular networks. The initial studies showed that D2D communications has advantages such as increased spectral efficiency and reduced communication delay. However, this communication mode introduces complications in terms of interference control overhead and protocols that are still open research problems. The feasibility of D2D communications in Long-Term Evolution Advanced is being studied by academia, industry, and standardization bodies. To date, there are more than 100 papers available on D2D communications in cellular networks, but there is no survey on this field. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy based on the D2D communicating spectrum and review the available literature extensively under the proposed taxonomy. Moreover, we provide new insights into the over-explored and under-explored areas that lead us to identify open research problems of D2D communications in cellular networks.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a flying base station used to provide the fly wireless communications to a given geographical area is analyzed. In particular, the coexistence between the UAV, that is transmitting data in the downlink, and an underlaid device-to-device (D2D) communication network is considered. For this model, a tractable analytical framework for the coverage and rate analysis is derived. Two scenarios are considered: a static UAV and a mobile UAV. In the first scenario, the average coverage probability and the system sum-rate for the users in the area are derived as a function of the UAV altitude and the number of D2D users. In the second scenario, using the disk covering problem, the minimum number of stop points that the UAV needs to visit in order to completely cover the area is computed. Furthermore, considering multiple retransmissions for the UAV and D2D users, the overall outage probability of the D2D users is derived. Simulation and analytical results show that, depending on the density of D2D users, the optimal values for the UAV altitude, which lead to the maximum system sum-rate and coverage probability, exist. Moreover, our results also show that, by enabling the UAV to intelligently move over the target area, the total required transmit power of UAV while covering the entire area, can be minimized. Finally, in order to provide full coverage for the area of interest, the tradeoff between the coverage and delay, in terms of the number of stop points, is discussed.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Device-to-device (D2D) communications over the licensed wireless spectrum has been recently proposed as a promising technology to meet the capacity crunch of next generation cellular networks. However, due to the high mobility of cellular devices, establishing and ensuring the success of D2D transmission become a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed to enable devices to form multi-hop D2D connections in an effort to maintain sustainable communication in the presence of device mobility. To solve the problem posed by device mobility, in contrast to existing works, which mostly focus on physical domain information, a durable community-based approach is introduced taking social encounters into context. It is shown that the proposed scheme can derive an optimal solution for time sensitive content transmission while also minimizing the cost that the base station pays in order to incentivize users to participate in D2D. Simulation results show that the proposed social community aware approach yields significant performance gain, in terms of the amount of traffic offloaded from the cellular network to the D2D tier, compared with the classical social-unaware methods.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This article explores one of the key enablers of beyond $4$G wireless networks leveraging small cell network deployments, namely proactive caching. Endowed with predictive capabilities and harnessing recent developments in storage, context-awareness and social networks, peak traffic demands can be substantially reduced by proactively serving predictable user demands, via caching at base stations and users' devices. In order to show the effectiveness of proactive caching, we examine two case studies which exploit the spatial and social structure of the network, where proactive caching plays a crucial role. Firstly, in order to alleviate backhaul congestion, we propose a mechanism whereby files are proactively cached during off-peak demands based on file popularity and correlations among users and files patterns. Secondly, leveraging social networks and device-to-device (D2D) communications, we propose a procedure that exploits the social structure of the network by predicting the set of influential users to (proactively) cache strategic contents and disseminate them to their social ties via D2D communications. Exploiting this proactive caching paradigm, numerical results show that important gains can be obtained for each case study, with backhaul savings and a higher ratio of satisfied users of up to $22\%$ and $26\%$, respectively. Higher gains can be further obtained by increasing the storage capability at the network edge.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We propose that hypergraphs can be used to model social networks with overlapping communities. The nodes of the hypergraphs represent the communities. The hyperlinks of the hypergraphs denote the individuals who may participate in multiple communities. The hypergraphs are not easy to analyze, however, the line graphs of hypergraphs are simple graphs or weighted graphs, so that the network theory can be applied. We define the overlapping depth $k$ of an individual by the number of communities that overlap in that individual, and we prove that the minimum adjacency eigenvalue of the corresponding line graph is not smaller than $-k_{max}$, which is the maximum overlapping depth of the whole network. Based on hypergraphs with preferential attachment, we establish a network model which incorporates overlapping communities with tunable overlapping parameters $k$ and $w$. By comparing with the Hyves social network, we show that our social network model possesses high clustering, assortative mixing, power-law degree distribution and short average path length.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In this paper, the problem of distributed caching in dense wireless small cell networks (SCNs) is studied using mean field games (MFGs). In the considered SCN, small base stations (SBSs) are equipped with data storage units and cooperate to serve users' requests either from files cached in the storage or directly from the capacity-limited backhaul. The aim of the SBSs is to define a caching policy that reduces the load on the capacity-limited backhaul links. This cache control problem is formulated as a stochastic differential game (SDG). In this game, each SBS takes into consideration the storage state of the other SBSs to decide on the fraction of content it should cache. To solve this problem, the formulated SDG is reduced to an MFG by considering an ultra-dense network of SBSs in which the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium is shown to be guaranteed. Simulation results show that this framework allows an efficient use of the available storage space at the SBSs while properly tracking the files' popularity. The results also show that, compared to a baseline model in which SBSs are not aware of the instantaneous system state, the proposed framework increases the number of served files from the SBSs by more than 69%.</data>
