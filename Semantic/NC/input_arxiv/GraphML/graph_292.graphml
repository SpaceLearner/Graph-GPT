      <data key="title">adadelta an adaptive learning rate method</data>
      <data key="abstract">We present a novel per-dimension learning rate method for gradient descent called ADADELTA. The method dynamically adapts over time using only first order information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla stochastic gradient descent. The method requires no manual tuning of a learning rate and appears robust to noisy gradient information, different model architecture choices, various data modalities and selection of hyperparameters. We show promising results compared to other methods on the MNIST digit classification task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed cluster environment.</data>

      <data key="title">beyond temporal pooling recurrence and temporal convolutions for gesture recognition in video</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recent studies have demonstrated the power of recurrent neural networks for machine translation, image captioning and speech recognition. For the task of capturing temporal structure in video, however, there still remain numerous open research questions. Current research suggests using a simple temporal feature pooling strategy to take into account the temporal aspect of video. We demonstrate that this method is not sufficient for gesture recognition, where temporal information is more discriminative compared to general video classification tasks. We explore deep architectures for gesture recognition in video and propose a new end-to-end trainable neural network architecture incorporating temporal convolutions and bidirectional recurrence. Our main contributions are twofold; first, we show that recurrence is crucial for this task; second, we show that adding temporal convolutions leads to significant improvements. We evaluate the different approaches on the Montalbano gesture recognition dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.</data>

      <data key="title">building end to end dialogue systems using generative hierarchical neural network models</data>
      <data key="abstract">We investigate the task of building open domain, conversational dialogue systems based on large dialogue corpora using generative models. Generative models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word, opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models. We investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings.</data>

      <data key="title">unsupervised domain adaptation using approximate label matching</data>
      <data key="abstract">Domain adaptation addresses the problem created when training data is generated by a so-called source distribution, but test data is generated by a significantly different target distribution. In this work, we present approximate label matching (ALM), a new unsupervised domain adaptation technique that creates and leverages a rough labeling on the test samples, then uses these noisy labels to learn a transformation that aligns the source and target samples. We show that the transformation estimated by ALM has favorable properties compared to transformations estimated by other methods, which do not use any kind of target labeling. Our model is regularized by requiring that a classifier trained to discriminate source from transformed target samples cannot distinguish between the two. We experiment with ALM on simulated and real data, and show that it outperforms techniques commonly used in the field.</data>

      <data key="title">predicting deep zero shot convolutional neural networks using textual descriptions</data>
      <data key="abstract">One of the main challenges in Zero-Shot Learning of visual categories is gathering semantic attributes to accompany images. Recent work has shown that learning from textual descriptions, such as Wikipedia articles, avoids the problem of having to explicitly define these attributes. We present a new model that can classify unseen categories from their textual description. Specifically, we use text features to predict the output weights of both the convolutional and the fully connected layers in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We take advantage of the architecture of CNNs and learn features at different layers, rather than just learning an embedding space for both modalities, as is common with existing approaches. The proposed model also allows us to automatically generate a list of pseudo- attributes for each visual category consisting of words from Wikipedia articles. We train our models end-to-end us- ing the Caltech-UCSD bird and flower datasets and evaluate both ROC and Precision-Recall curves. Our empirical results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods.</data>

      <data key="title">nice non linear independent components estimation</data>
      <data key="abstract">We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.</data>

      <data key="title">domain adaptation with conditional distribution matching and generalized label shift</data>
      <data key="abstract">Adversarial learning has demonstrated good performance in the unsupervised domain adaptation setting, by learning domain-invariant representations that perform well on the source domain. However, recent work has underlined limitations of existing methods in the presence of mismatched label distributions between the source and target domains. In this paper, we extend a recent upper-bound on the performance of adversarial domain adaptation to multi-class classification and more general discriminators. We then propose generalized label shift (GLS) as a way to improve robustness against mismatched label distributions. GLS states that, conditioned on the label, there exists a representation of the input that is invariant between the source and target domains. Under GLS, we provide theoretical guarantees on the transfer performance of any classifier. We also devise necessary and sufficient conditions for GLS to hold. The conditions are based on the estimation of the relative class weights between domains and on an appropriate reweighting of samples. Guided by our theoretical insights, we modify three widely used algorithms, JAN, DANN and CDAN and evaluate their performance on standard domain adaptation tasks where our method outperforms the base versions. We also demonstrate significant gains on artificially created tasks with large divergences between their source and target label distributions.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We introduce Embed to Control (E2C), a method for model learning and control of non-linear dynamical systems from raw pixel images. E2C consists of a deep generative model, belonging to the family of variational autoencoders, that learns to generate image trajectories from a latent space in which the dynamics is constrained to be locally linear. Our model is derived directly from an optimal control formulation in latent space, supports long-term prediction of image sequences and exhibits strong performance on a variety of complex control problems.</data>

      <data key="title">fast large scale optimization by unifying stochastic gradient and quasi newton methods</data>
      <data key="abstract">We present an algorithm for minimizing a sum of functions that combines the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the second order curvature information leveraged by quasi-Newton methods. We unify these disparate approaches by maintaining an independent Hessian approximation for each contributing function in the sum. We maintain computational tractability and limit memory requirements even for high dimensional optimization problems by storing and manipulating these quadratic approximations in a shared, time evolving, low dimensional subspace. Each update step requires only a single contributing function or minibatch evaluation (as in SGD), and each step is scaled using an approximate inverse Hessian and little to no adjustment of hyperparameters is required (as is typical for quasi-Newton methods). This algorithm contrasts with earlier stochastic second order techniques that treat the Hessian of each contributing function as a noisy approximation to the full Hessian, rather than as a target for direct estimation. We experimentally demonstrate improved convergence on seven diverse optimization problems. The algorithm is released as open source Python and MATLAB packages.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper introduces the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, a dataset containing almost 1 million multi-turn dialogues, with a total of over 7 million utterances and 100 million words. This provides a unique resource for research into building dialogue managers based on neural language models that can make use of large amounts of unlabeled data. The dataset has both the multi-turn property of conversations in the Dialog State Tracking Challenge datasets, and the unstructured nature of interactions from microblog services such as Twitter.

      <data key="title">new perspectives on the natural gradient method</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this report we review and discuss some theoretical aspects of Amari's natural gradient method, provide a unifying picture of the many different versions of it which have appeared over the years, and offer some new insights and perspectives regarding the method and its relationship to other optimization methods. Among our various contributions is the identification of a general condition under which the Fisher information matrix and Schraudolph's generalized Gauss-Newton matrix are equivalent. This equivalence implies that optimization methods which use the latter matrix, such as the Hessian-free optimization approach of Martens, are actually natural gradient methods in disguise. It also lets us view natural gradient methods as approximate Newton methods, justifying the application of various "update damping" techniques to them, which are designed to compensate for break-downs in local quadratic approximations. Additionally, we analyze the parameterization invariance possessed by the natural gradient method in the idealized setting of infinitesimally small update steps, and consider the extent to which it holds for practical versions of the method which take large discrete steps. We go on to show that parameterization invariance is not possessed by the classical Newton-Raphson method (even in the idealized setting), and then give a general characterization of gradient-based methods which do possess it.</data>

      <data key="title">revisiting natural gradient for deep networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">We evaluate natural gradient, an algorithm originally proposed in Amari (1997), for learning deep models. The contributions of this paper are as follows. We show the connection between natural gradient and three other recently proposed methods for training deep models: Hessian-Free (Martens, 2010), Krylov Subspace Descent (Vinyals and Povey, 2012) and TONGA (Le Roux et al., 2008). We describe how one can use unlabeled data to improve the generalization error obtained by natural gradient and empirically evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to the ordering of the training set compared to stochastic gradient descent. Finally we extend natural gradient to incorporate second order information alongside the manifold information and provide a benchmark of the new algorithm using a truncated Newton approach for inverting the metric matrix instead of using a diagonal approximation of it.</data>

      <data key="title">improving neural networks by preventing co adaptation of feature detectors</data>
      <data key="abstract">When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper presents a new classification methods for Event Related Potentials (ERP) based on an Information geometry framework. Through a new estimation of covariance matrices, this work extend the use of Riemannian geometry, which was previously limited to SMR-based BCI, to the problem of classification of ERPs. As compared to the state-of-the-art, this new method increases performance, reduces the number of data needed for the calibration and features good generalisation across sessions and subjects. This method is illustrated on data recorded with the P300-based game brain invaders. Finally, an online and adaptive implementation is described, where the BCI is initialized with generic parameters derived from a database and continuously adapt to the individual, allowing the user to play the game without any calibration while keeping a high accuracy.</data>

      <data key="title">speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for sequential data. End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates \emph{deep recurrent neural networks}, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper shows how Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural networks can be used to generate complex sequences with long-range structure, simply by predicting one data point at a time. The approach is demonstrated for text (where the data are discrete) and online handwriting (where the data are real-valued). It is then extended to handwriting synthesis by allowing the network to condition its predictions on a text sequence. The resulting system is able to generate highly realistic cursive handwriting in a wide variety of styles.</data>

      <data key="title">domain generalization for object recognition with multi task autoencoders</data>
      <data key="abstract">The problem of domain generalization is to take knowledge acquired from a number of related domains where training data is available, and to then successfully apply it to previously unseen domains. We propose a new feature learning algorithm, Multi-Task Autoencoder (MTAE), that provides good generalization performance for cross-domain object recognition. #R##N#Our algorithm extends the standard denoising autoencoder framework by substituting artificially induced corruption with naturally occurring inter-domain variability in the appearance of objects. Instead of reconstructing images from noisy versions, MTAE learns to transform the original image into analogs in multiple related domains. It thereby learns features that are robust to variations across domains. The learnt features are then used as inputs to a classifier. #R##N#We evaluated the performance of the algorithm on benchmark image recognition datasets, where the task is to learn features from multiple datasets and to then predict the image label from unseen datasets. We found that (denoising) MTAE outperforms alternative autoencoder-based models as well as the current state-of-the-art algorithms for domain generalization.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present doubly stochastic gradient MCMC, a simple and generic method for (approximate) Bayesian inference of deep generative models (DGMs) in a collapsed continuous parameter space. At each MCMC sampling step, the algorithm randomly draws a mini-batch of data samples to estimate the gradient of log-posterior and further estimates the intractable expectation over hidden variables via a neural adaptive importance sampler, where the proposal distribution is parameterized by a deep neural network and learnt jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness on learning various DGMs in a wide range of tasks, including density estimation, data generation and missing data imputation.

      <data key="title">adam a method for stochastic optimization</data>
      <data key="abstract">We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.</data>
