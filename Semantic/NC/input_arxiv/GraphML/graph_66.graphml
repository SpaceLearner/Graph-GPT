      <data key="title">the tournaments metaphor in citation impact studies power weakness ratios pwr as a journal indicator</data>
      <data key="abstract">Ramanujacharyulu's (1964) Power-Weakness Ratio (PWR) measures impact by recursively multiplying the citation matrix by itself until convergence is reached in both the cited and citing dimensions; the quotient of these values is defined as PWR, whereby "cited" is considered as power and "citing" as weakness. Analytically, PWR is an attractive candidate for measuring journal impact because of its symmetrical handling of the rows and columns in the asymmetrical citation matrix, its recursive algorithm, and its mathematical elegance. In this study, PWR is discussed and critically assessed in relation to other size-independent recursive metrics. A test using the set of 83 journals in "information and library science" (according to the Web-of-Science categorization) converged, but did not provide interpretable results. Further decomposition of this set into homogeneous sub-graphs shows that--like most other journal indicators--PWR can perhaps be used within homogeneous sets, but not across citation communities.</data>

      <data key="title">pagerank beyond the web</data>
      <data key="abstract">Google's PageRank method was developed to evaluate the importance of web-pages via their link structure. The mathematics of PageRank, however, are entirely general and apply to any graph or network in any domain. Thus, PageRank is now regularly used in bibliometrics, social and information network analysis, and for link prediction and recommendation. It's even used for systems analysis of road networks, as well as biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics. We'll see the mathematics and ideas that unite these diverse applications.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Wikipedia is a huge global repository of human knowledge that can be leveraged to investigate interwinements between cultures. With this aim, we apply methods of Markov chains and Google matrix for the analysis of the hyperlink networks of 24 Wikipedia language editions, and rank all their articles by PageRank, 2DRank and CheiRank algorithms. Using automatic extraction of people names, we obtain the top 100 historical figures, for each edition and for each algorithm. We investigate their spatial, temporal, and gender distributions in dependence of their cultural origins. Our study demonstrates not only the existence of skewness with local figures, mainly recognized only in their own cultures, but also the existence of global historical figures appearing in a large number of editions. By determining the birth time and place of these persons, we perform an analysis of the evolution of such figures through 35 centuries of human history for each language, thus recovering interactions and entanglement of cultures over time. We also obtain the distributions of historical figures over world countries, highlighting geographical aspects of cross-cultural links. Considering historical figures who appear in multiple editions as interactions between cultures, we construct a network of cultures and identify the most influential cultures according to this network.</data>

      <data key="title">two dimensional ranking of wikipedia articles</data>
      <data key="abstract">The Library of Babel, described by Jorge Luis Borges, stores an enormous amount of information. The Library exists ab aeterno. Wikipedia, a free online encyclopaedia, becomes a modern analogue of such a Library. Information retrieval and ranking of Wikipedia articles become the challenge of modern society. While PageRank highlights very well known nodes with many ingoing links, CheiRank highlights very communicative nodes with many outgoing links. In this way the ranking becomes two-dimensional. Using CheiRank and PageRank we analyze the properties of two-dimensional ranking of all Wikipedia English articles and show that it gives their reliable classification with rich and nontrivial features. Detailed studies are done for countries, universities, personalities, physicists, chess players, Dow-Jones companies and other categories.</data>

      <data key="title">highlighting entanglement of cultures via ranking of multilingual wikipedia articles</data>
      <data key="abstract">How different cultures evaluate a person? Is an important person in one culture is also important in the other culture? We address these questions via ranking of multilingual Wikipedia articles. With three ranking algorithms based on network structure of Wikipedia, we assign ranking to all articles in 9 multilingual editions of Wikipedia and investigate general ranking structure of PageRank, CheiRank and 2DRank. In particular, we focus on articles related to persons, identify top 30 persons for each rank among different editions and analyze distinctions of their distributions over activity fields such as politics, art, science, religion, sport for each edition. We find that local heroes are dominant but also global heroes exist and create an effective network representing entanglement of cultures. The Google matrix analysis of network of cultures shows signs of the Zipf law distribution. This approach allows to examine diversity and shared characteristics of knowledge organization between cultures. The developed computational, data driven approach highlights cultural interconnections in a new perspective. Dated: June 26, 2013</data>

      <data key="title">toward two dimensional search engines</data>
      <data key="abstract">We study the statistical properties of various directed networks using ranking of their nodes based on the dominant vectors of the Google matrix known as PageRank and CheiRank. On average PageRank orders nodes proportionally to a number of ingoing links, while CheiRank orders nodes proportionally to a number of outgoing links. In this way, the ranking of nodes becomes two dimensional which paves the way for the development of two-dimensional search engines of a new type. Statistical properties of information flow on the PageRank–CheiRank plane are analyzed for networks of British, French and Italian universities, Wikipedia, Linux Kernel, gene regulation and other networks. A special emphasis is done for British universities networks using the large database publicly available in the UK. Methods of spam links control are also analyzed.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We study numerically the spectrum and eigenstate properties of the Google matrix of various examples of directed networks such as vocabulary networks of dictionaries and university World Wide Web networks. The spectra have gapless structure in the vicinity of the maximal eigenvalue for Google damping parameter $\ensuremath{\alpha}$ equal to unity. The vocabulary networks have relatively homogeneous spectral density, while university networks have pronounced spectral structures which change from one university to another, reflecting specific properties of the networks. We also determine specific properties of eigenstates of the Google matrix, including the PageRank. The fidelity of the PageRank is proposed as a characterization of its stability.</data>

The Bitcoin network has up to a few millions of bitcoin users and we present its main characteristics including the PageRank and CheiRank probability distributions, the spectrum of eigenvalues of Google matrix and related eigenvectors. We find that the spectrum has an unusual circle-type structure which we attribute to existing hidden communities of nodes linked between their members.

      <data key="title">fractal weyl law for linux kernel architecture</data>
      <data key="abstract">We study the properties of spectrum and eigenstates of the Google matrix of a directed network formed by the procedure calls in the Linux Kernel. Our results obtained for various versions of the Linux Kernel show that the spectrum is characterized by the fractal Weyl law established recently for systems of quantum chaotic scattering and the Perron-Frobenius operators of dynamical maps. The fractal Weyl exponent is found to be ν ≈ 0.65 that corresponds to the fractal dimension of the network d ≈ 1.3. An independent computation of the fractal dimension by the cluster growing method, generalized for directed networks, gives a close value d ≈ 1.4. The eigenmodes of the Google matrix of Linux Kernel are localized on certain principal nodes. We argue that the fractal Weyl law should be generic for directed networks with the fractal dimension d &gt; 2. Copyright EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present a new concept - Wikiometrics - the derivation of metrics and indicators from Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides an accurate representation of the real world due to its size, structure, editing policy and popularity. We demonstrate an innovative mining methodology, where different elements of Wikipedia - content, structure, editorial actions and reader reviews - are used to rank items in a manner which is by no means inferior to rankings produced by experts or other methods. We test our proposed method by applying it to two real-world ranking problems: top world universities and academic journals. Our proposed ranking methods were compared to leading and widely accepted benchmarks, and were found to be extremely correlative but with the advantage of the data being publically available.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We study the properties of the Google matrix generated by a coarse-grained Perron-Frobenius operator of the Chirikov typical map with dissipation. The finite-size matrix approximant of this operator is constructed by the Ulam method. This method applied to the simple dynamical model generates directed Ulam networks with approximate scale-free scaling and characteristics being in certain features similar to those of the world wide web with approximate scale-free degree distributions as well as two characteristics similar to the web: a power-law decay in PageRank that mirrors the decay of PageRank on the world wide web and a sensitivity to the value $\ensuremath{\alpha}$ in PageRank. The simple dynamical attractors play here the role of popular websites with a strong concentration of PageRank. A variation in the Google parameter $\ensuremath{\alpha}$ or other parameters of the dynamical map can drive the PageRank of the Google matrix to a delocalized phase with a strange attractor where the Google search becomes inefficient.</data>

Our studies show much stronger inter-connectivity between top PageRank nodes for the Twitter network compared to the networks of Wikipedia and British Universities studied previously. Our analysis allows to locate the top Twitter users which control the information flow on the network. We argue that this small fraction of the whole number of users, which can be viewed as the social network elite, plays the dominant role in the process of opinion formation on the network.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Functioning of business processes of high-tech enterprise is in a constant interaction with the environment. Herewith a wide range of such interaction represents a variety of conflicts affecting the achievement of the goals of business processes. All these things lead to the disruption of functioning of business processes. That’s why modern enterprises should have mechanisms to provide a new property of business processes – ability to maintain and/or restore functions in various adverse effects. This property is called functional stability of business processes (FSBP). In this article we offer, showcase and test the new approach to assessing the results of business process re-engineering by simulating their functional stability before and after re-engineering.</data>

We construct a directed network using a suitable definition of tactical moves including local patterns, and study this network for different datasets of professional and amateur games. The move distribution follows Zipf's law and the network is scale free, with statistical peculiarities different from other real directed networks, such as, e.g., the World Wide Web. These specificities reflect in the outcome of ranking algorithms applied to it. The fine study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices used by the ranking algorithms singles out certain strategic situations. Our results should pave the way to a better modelization of board games and other types of human strategic scheming.</data>

      <data key="title">towards physical laws for software architecture</data>
      <data key="abstract">Starting from the pioneering works on software architecture precious guidelines have emerged to indicate how computer programs should be organized. For example the "separation of concerns" suggests to split a program into modules that overlap in functionality as little as possible. However these recommendations are mainly conceptual and are thus hard to express in a quantitative form. Hence software architecture relies on the individual experience and skill of the designers rather than on quantitative laws. In this article I apply the methods developed for the classification of information on the World-Wide-Web to study the organization of Open Source programs in an attempt to establish the statistical laws governing software architecture.</data>

      <data key="title">google matrix of business process management</data>
      <data key="abstract">Development of efficient business process models and determination of their characteristic properties are subject of intense interdisciplinary research. Here, we consider a business process model as a directed graph. Its nodes correspond to the units identified by the modeler and the link direction indicates the causal dependencies between units. It is of primary interest to obtain the stationary flow on such a directed graph, which corresponds to the steady-state of a firm during the business process. Following the ideas developed recently for the World Wide Web, we construct the Google matrix for our business process model and analyze its spectral properties. The importance of nodes is characterized by Page-Rank and recently proposed CheiRank and 2DRank, respectively. The results show that this two-dimensional ranking gives a significant information about the influence and communication properties of business model units. We argue that the Google matrix method, described here, provides a new efficient tool helping companies to make their decisions on how to evolve in the exceedingly dynamic global market.</data>

This approach allows to incorporate various cultural views on world universities using the mathematical statistical analysis independent of cultural preferences. The Wikipedia ranking of top 100 universities provides about 60% overlap with the Shanghai university ranking demonstrating the reliable features of this approach. At the same time WRWU incorporates all knowledge accumulated at 24 Wikipedia editions giving stronger highlights for historically important universities leading to a different estimation of efficiency of world countries in university education. The historical development of university ranking is analyzed during ten centuries of their history.</data>
