      <data key="title">physical layer network coding tutorial survey and beyond</data>
      <data key="abstract">The concept of physical-layer network coding (PNC) was proposed in 2006 for application in wireless networks. Since then it has developed into a subfield of network coding with wide followings. The basic idea of PNC is to exploit the network coding operation that occurs naturally when electromagnetic (EM) waves are superimposed on one another. This simple idea turns out to have profound and fundamental ramifications. Subsequent works by various researchers have led to many new results in the domains of 1) wireless communication; 2) wireless information theory; and 3) wireless networking. The purpose of this paper is fourfold. First, we give a brief tutorial on the basic concept of PNC. Second, we survey and discuss recent key results in the three aforementioned areas. Third, we examine a critical issue in PNC: synchronization. It has been a common belief that PNC requires tight synchronization. Our recent results suggest, however, that PNC may actually benefit from asynchrony. Fourth, we propose that PNC is not just for wireless networks; it can also be useful in optical networks. We provide an example showing that the throughput of a passive optical network (PON) could potentially be raised by 100% with PNC.</data>

      <data key="title">towards the optimal amplify and forward cooperative diversity scheme</data>
      <data key="abstract">In a slow fading channel, how to find a cooperative diversity scheme that achieves the transmit diversity bound is still an open problem. In fact, all previously proposed amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) schemes do not improve with the number of relays in terms of the diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for multiplexing gains r higher than 0.5. In this work, we study the class of slotted amplify-and-forward (SAF) schemes. We first establish an upper bound on the DMT for any SAF scheme with an arbitrary number of relays N and number of slots M. Then, we propose a sequential SAF scheme that can exploit the potential diversity gain in the high multiplexing gain regime. More precisely, in certain conditions, the sequential SAF scheme achieves the proposed DMT upper bound which tends to the transmit diversity bound when M goes to infinity. In particular, for the two-relay case, the three-slot sequential SAF scheme achieves the proposed upper bound and outperforms the two-relay non-orthorgonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) scheme of Azarian et al. for multiplexing gains r &lt; 2/3. Numerical results reveal a significant gain of our scheme over the previously proposed AF schemes, especially in high spectral efficiency and large network size regime.</data>

      <data key="title">design of an miso swipt aided code index modulated multi carrier m dcsk system for e health iot</data>
      <data key="abstract">Code index modulated multi-carrier M-ary differential chaos shift keying (CIM-MC-M-DCSK) system not only inherits low-power and low-complexity advantages of the conventional DCSK system, but also significantly increases the transmission rate. This feature is of particular importance to Internet of Things (IoT) with trillions of low-cost devices. In particular, for e-health IoT applications, an efficient transmission scheme is designed to solve the challenge of the limited battery capacity for numerous user equipments served by one base station. In this paper, a new multiple-input-single-output simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (MISO-SWIPT) scheme for CIM-MC-M-DCSK system is proposed by utilizing orthogonal characteristic of chaotic signals with different initial values. The proposed system adopts power splitting mode, which is very promising for simultaneously providing energy and transmitting information of the user equipments without any external power supply. In particular, the new system can achieve desirable anti-multipath-fading capability without using channel estimator. Moreover, the analytical bit-error-rate expression of the proposed system is derived over multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of the proposed system are analyzed. Simulation results not only validate the analytical expressions, but also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system.</data>

      <data key="title">achievable rate of rician large scale mimo channels with transceiver hardware impairments</data>
      <data key="abstract">Transceiver hardware impairments (e.g., phase noise, in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance, amplifier nonlinearities, and quantization errors) have obvious degradation effects on the performance of wireless communications. While prior works have improved our knowledge of the influence of hardware impairments of single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems over Rayleigh fading channels, an analysis encompassing the Rician fading channel is not yet available. In this paper, we pursue a detailed analysis of regular and large-scale (LS) MIMO systems over Rician fading channels by deriving new closed-form expressions for the achievable rate to provide several important insights for practical system design. More specifically, for regular MIMO systems with hardware impairments, there is always a finite achievable rate ceiling, which is irrespective of the transmit power and fading conditions. For LS-MIMO systems, it is interesting to find that the achievable rate loss depends on the Rician    $K$  - factor, which reveals that the favorable propagation in LS-MIMO systems can remove the influence of hardware impairments. However, we show that the nonideal LS-MIMO system can still achieve high spectral efficiency due to its huge degrees of freedom.</data>

      <data key="title">reliable physical layer network coding</data>
      <data key="abstract">When two or more users in a wireless network transmit simultaneously, their electromagnetic signals are linearly superimposed on the channel. As a result, a receiver that is interested in one of these signals sees the others as unwanted interference. This property of the wireless medium is typically viewed as a hindrance to reliable communication over a network. However, using a recently developed coding strategy, interference can in fact be harnessed for network coding. In a wired network, (linear) network coding refers to each intermediate node taking its received packets, computing a linear combination over a finite field, and forwarding the outcome towards the destinations. Then, given an appropriate set of linear combinations, a destination can solve for its desired packets. For certain topologies, this strategy can attain significantly higher throughputs over routing-based strategies. Reliable physical layer network coding takes this idea one step further: using judiciously chosen linear error-correcting codes, intermediate nodes in a wireless network can directly recover linear combinations of the packets from the observed noisy superpositions of transmitted signals. Starting with some simple examples, this survey explores the core ideas behind this new technique and the possibilities it offers for communication over interference-limited wireless networks.</data>

      <data key="title">performance of mimo relay dcsk cd systems over nakagami fading channels</data>
      <data key="abstract">A multi-access multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay differential chaos shift keying cooperative diversity (DCSK-CD) system is proposed in this paper as a comprehensive cooperation scheme, in which the relay and destination both employ multiple antennas to strengthen the robustness against signal fading in a wireless network. It is shown that, with spatial diversity gains, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system is remarkably better than the conventional DCSK non-cooperation (DCSK-NC) and DCSK cooperative communication (DCSK-CC) systems. Moreover, the exact BER and close-form expressions of the proposed system are derived over Nakagami fading channels through the moment generating function (MGF), which is shown to be highly consistent with the simulation results. Meanwhile, this paper illustrates a trade-off between the performance and the complexity, and provides a threshold for the number of relay antennas keeping the user consumed energy constant. Due to the above-mentioned advantages, the proposed system stands out as a good candidate or alternative for energy-constrained wireless communications based on chaotic modulation, especially for low-power and low-cost wireless personal area networks (WPANs).</data>

      <data key="title">spectral efficiency of multipair massive mimo two way relaying with hardware impairments</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider a multipair massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relaying system, where multiple pairs of single-antenna devices exchange data with the help of a relay employing a large number of antennas $N$. The relay consists of low-cost components that suffer from hardware impairments. A large-scale approximation of the spectral efficiency (SE) with maximum ratio (MR) processing is derived in closed form, and the approximation is tight as $N \to \infty$. It is revealed that for a fixed hardware quality, the impact of the hardware impairments vanishes asymptotically when $N$ grows large. Moreover, the impact of the impairments may even vanish when the hardware quality is gradually decreased with $N$, if a scaling law is satisfied. Finally, numerical results validate that multipair massive MIMO two-way relaying systems are robust to hardware impairments at the relay.</data>

      <data key="title">opportunistic wireless energy harvesting in cognitive radio networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wireless networks can be self-sustaining by harvesting energy from ambient radio-frequency (RF) signals. Recently, researchers have made progress on designing efficient circuits and devices for RF energy harvesting suitable for low-power wireless applications. Motivated by this and building upon the classic cognitive radio (CR) network model, this paper proposes a novel method for wireless networks coexisting where low-power mobiles in a secondary network, called secondary transmitters (STs), harvest ambient RF energy from transmissions by nearby active transmitters in a primary network, called primary transmitters (PTs), while opportunistically accessing the spectrum licensed to the primary network. We consider a stochastic-geometry model in which PTs and STs are distributed as independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs) and communicate with their intended receivers at fixed distances. Each PT is associated with a guard zone to protect its intended receiver from ST's interference, and at the same time delivers RF energy to STs located in its harvesting zone. Based on the proposed model, we analyze the transmission probability of STs and the resulting spatial throughput of the secondary network. The optimal transmission power and density of STs are derived for maximizing the secondary network throughput under the given outage-probability constraints in the two coexisting networks, which reveal key insights to the optimal network design. Finally, we show that our analytical result can be generally applied to a non-CR setup, where distributed wireless power chargers are deployed to power coexisting wireless transmitters in a sensor network.</data>

      <data key="title">on the feasibility of wireless energy transfer using massive antenna arrays</data>
      <data key="abstract">We illustrate potential benefits of using massive antenna arrays for wireless energy transfer (WET). Specifically, we analyze probability of outage in WET over fading channels when a base station (BS) with multiple antennas beamforms energy to a wireless sensor node (WSN). Our analytical results show that by using massive antenna arrays, the range of WET can be increased for a given target outage probability. We prove that by using multiple-antenna arrays at the BS, a lower downlink energy is required to get the same outage performance, resulting in savings of radiated energy. We show that for energy levels used in WET, the outage performance with least-squares or minimum mean-square-error channel estimates is the same as that obtained based on perfect channel estimates. We observe that a strong line-of-sight component between the BS and WSN lowers outage probability. Furthermore, by deploying more antennas at the BS, a larger energy can be transferred reliably to the WSN at a given target outage performance for the sensor to be able to perform its main tasks. In our numerical examples, the RF power received at the input of the sensor is assumed to be on the order of a mW, such that the rectenna operates at an efficiency in the order of 50%.</data>

      <data key="title">modulation design for wireless information and power transfer with nonlinear energy harvester modeling</data>
      <data key="abstract">Far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) have become increasingly important in radio frequency (RF) and communication communities recently. The problem of modulation design for SWIPT has however been scarcely addressed. In this paper, a modulation scheme based on asymmetric phase-shift keying (PSK) is considered, which improves the SWIPT rate-energy tradeoff region significantly. The nonlinear rectifier model, which accurately models the energy harvester, is adopted for evaluating the output direct current (DC) power at the receiver. The harvested DC power is maximized under an average power constraint at the transmitter and a constraint on the rate of information transmitted via a multi-carrier signal over a flat fading channel. As a consequence of the rectifier nonlinearity, this work highlights that asymmetric PSK modulation provides benefits over conventional symmetric PSK modulation in SWIPT and opens the door to systematic modulation design tailored for SWIPT.</data>

      <data key="title">analysis of network coding schemes for differential chaos shift keying communication system</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper we design network coding schemes for Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) modulation. In this work, non-coherent chaos-based communication system is used due to its simplicity and robustness to multipath propagation effects, while dispensing with any channel state information knowledge at the receiver. We propose a relay network using network coding and DCSK, where we first present a Physical layer Network Coding (PNC) scheme with two users, A and B, sharing the same spreading code and bandwidth, while synchronously transmitting their signals to the relay node R. We show that the main drawback of this design in multipath channels is the high level of interference in the resultant signal, which severely degrades the system performance. Hence, in order to address this problem, we propose two coding schemes, which separate the users' signals in the frequency or the time domains. We show also in this paper that the performance of the Analog Network Coding (ANC) with DCSK modulation suffers from the same interference problem as the PNC scheme. We present the analytical bit error rate performance for multipath Rayleigh fading channel for the different scenarios and we analyse these schemes in terms of complexity, throughput and link spectral efficiency.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper carries out the first-ever investigation of the analysis of a cooperative Decode-and-Forward (DF) relay network with Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) modulation. The performance analysis of DF-CSK in this paper takes into account the dynamical nature of chaotic signal, which is not similar to a conventional binary modulation performance computation methodology. The expression of a lower bound bit error rate (BER) is derived in order to investigate the performance of the cooperative system under independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian fading wireless environments. The effect of the non-periodic nature of chaotic sequence leading to a non constant bit energy of the considered modulation is also investigated. A computation approach of the BER expression based on the probability density function of the bit energy of the chaotic sequence, channel distribution, and number of relays is presented. Simulation results prove the accuracy of our BER computation methodology.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This work presents another look at an analog network coding scheme for multi-user spread-spectrum com- munication systems. Our proposed system combines coding and cooperation between a relay and users to boost the throughput and to exploit interference. To this end, each pair of users, A and B, that communicate with each other via a relay R shares the same spreading code. The relay has two roles, it synchronizes network transmissions and it broadcasts the combined signals received from users. From user B's point of view, the signal is decoded, and then, the data transmitted by user A is recovered by subtracting user B's own data. We derive the analytical performance of this system for an additive white Gaussian noise channel with the presence of multi-user interference, and we confirm its accuracy by simulation.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Lattice codes are known to achieve capacity in the Gaussian point-to-point channel, achieving the same rates as independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random Gaussian codebooks. Lattice codes are also known to outperform random codes for certain channel models that are able to exploit their linearity. In this work, we show that lattice codes may be used to achieve the same performance as known i.i.d. Gaussian random coding techniques for the Gaussian relay channel, and show several examples of how this may be combined with the linearity of lattices codes in multi-source relay networks. In particular, we present a nested lattice list decoding technique, by which, lattice codes are shown to achieve the Decode-and-Forward (DF) rate of single source, single destination Gaussian relay channels with one or more relays. We next present two examples of how this DF scheme may be combined with the linearity of lattice codes to achieve new rate regions which for some channel conditions outperform analogous known Gaussian random coding techniques in multi-source relay channels. That is, we derive a new achievable rate region for the two-way relay channel with direct links and compare it to existing schemes, and derive another achievable rate region for the multiple access relay channel. We furthermore present a lattice Compress-and-Forward (CF) scheme for the Gaussian relay channel which exploits a lattice Wyner-Ziv binning scheme and achieves the same rate as the Cover-El Gamal CF rate evaluated for Gaussian random codes. These results suggest that structured/lattice codes may be used to mimic, and sometimes outperform, random Gaussian codes in general Gaussian networks.</data>

      <data key="title">iterative dynamic water filling for fading multiple access channels with energy harvesting</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we develop optimal energy scheduling algorithms for N-user fading multiple-access channels with energy harvesting to maximize the channel sum-rate, assuming that the side information of both the channel states and energy harvesting states for K time slots is known a priori, and the battery capacity and the maximum energy consumption in each time slot are bounded. The problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem with O (NK) constraints making it hard to solve using a general convex solver since the computational complexity of a generic convex solver becomes impractically high when the number of constraints is large. This paper gives an efficient energy scheduling algorithm, called the iterative dynamic water-filling algorithm, that has a computational complexity of O(NK#N# 2#N#) per iteration. For the single-user case, a dynamic water-filling method is shown to be optimal. Unlike the traditional water-filling algorithm, in dynamic water-filling, the water level is not constant but changes when the battery overflows or depletes. An iterative version of the dynamic water-filling algorithm is shown to be optimal for the case of multiple users. Even though in principle the optimality is achieved under large number of iterations, in practice convergence is reached in only a few iterations. Moreover, a single iteration of the dynamic water-filling algorithm achieves a sum-rate that is within (N-1)K nats of the optimal sum-rate.</data>

      <data key="title">rate energy region in wireless information and power transfer new receiver architecture and practical modulation</data>
      <data key="abstract">When simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is carried out, a fundamental tradeoff between achievable rate and harvested energy exists because the received power is used for two different purposes. The tradeoff is well characterized by the rate-energy region, and several techniques have been proposed to improve the achievable rate-energy region. However, the existing techniques still have a considerable loss in either energy or rate and thus the known achievable rate-energy regions are far from the ideal one. Deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the rate-energy region of our proposed scheme, we prove that the rate-energy region can be expanded almost to the ideal upper bound. Contrary to the existing techniques, in the proposed scheme, the information decoding circuit not only extracts amplitude and phase information but also combines the extracted information with the amplitude information obtained from the rectified signal. Consequently, the required energy for decoding can be minimized, and thus the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal rate-energy region, which implies that the fundamental tradeoff in the achievable rate-energy region is nearly eliminated. To practically account for the theoretically achievable rate-energy region, we also present practical examples with an $M$-ary multi-level circular QAM with Gaussian maximum likelihood detection.</data>

      <data key="abstract">A new Multi-Carrier Differential Chaos Shift Keying (MC-DCSK) modulation is presented in this paper. The system endeavors to provide a good trade-off between robustness, energy efficiency and high data rate, while still being simple compared to conventional multi-carrier spread spectrum systems. This system can be seen as a parallel extension of the DCSK modulation where one chaotic reference sequence is transmitted over a predefined subcarrier frequency. Multiple modulated data streams are transmitted over the remaining subcarriers. This transmitter structure increases the spectral efficiency of the conventional DCSK system and uses less energy. The receiver design makes this system easy to implement where no radio frequency (RF) delay circuit is needed to demodulate received data. Various system design parameters are discussed throughout the paper, including the number of subcarriers, the spreading factor, and the transmitted energy. Once the design is explained, the bit error rate performance of the MC-DCSK system is computed and compared to the conventional DCSK system under multipath Rayleigh fading and an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Simulation results confirm the advantages of this new hybrid design.</data>

      <data key="title">wireless information and power transfer a dynamic power splitting approach</data>
      <data key="abstract">Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called "rate-energy (R-E)" region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. The achievable R-E region by the proposed DPS scheme is also compared against that by the existing time switching scheme as well as a performance upper bound by ignoring the practical receiver constraint. Finally, we extend the result for optimal DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system where the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. In particular, we investigate a low-complexity power splitting scheme, namely antenna switching, which achieves the near-optimal rate-energy trade-offs as compared to the optimal DPS.</data>

We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power transferred to all EH receivers subject to given minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at different ID receivers. In particular, we consider two types of ID receivers (referred to as Type I and Type II, respectively) without or with the capability of cancelling the interference from (a priori known) energy signals. For each type of ID receivers, we formulate the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). First, we obtain the globally optimal solutions for our formulated QCQPs by applying an optimization technique so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). It is shown via SDR that under the condition of independently distributed user channels, no dedicated energy beam is used for the case of Type I ID receivers to achieve the optimal solution; while for the case of Type II ID receivers, employing no more than one energy beam is optimal. Next, we establish a new form of the celebrated uplink-downlink duality for our studied downlink beamforming problems, and thereby develop alternative algorithms to obtain the same optimal solutions as by SDR. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of proposed optimal beamforming designs for MISO SWIPT systems.</data>
