      <data key="title">bridging online and offline social networks multiplex analysis</data>
      <data key="abstract">We show that three basic actor characteristics, namely normalized reciprocity, three cycles, and triplets, can be expressed using an unified framework that is based on computing the similarity index between two sets associated with the actor: the set of her/his friends and the set of those considering her/him as a friend. These metrics are extended to multiplex networks and then computed for two friendship networks generated by collecting data from two groups of undergraduate students. We found that in offline communication strong and weak ties are (almost) equally presented, while in online communication weak ties are dominant. Moreover, weak ties are much less reciprocal than strong ties. However, across different layers of the multiplex network reciprocities are preserved, while triads (measured with normalized three cycles and triplets) are not significant.</data>

      <data key="title">you know because i know a multidimensional network approach to human resources problem</data>
      <data key="abstract">Finding talents, often among the people already hired, is an endemic challenge for organizations. The social networking revolution, with online tools like Linkedin, made possible to make explicit and accessible what we perceived, but not used, for thousands of years: the exact position and ranking of a person in a network of professional and personal connections. To search and mine where and how an employee is positioned on a global skill network will enable organizations to find unpredictable sources of knowledge, innovation and know-how. This data richness and hidden knowledge demands for a multidimensional and multiskill approach to the network ranking problem. Multidimensional networks are networks with multiple kinds of relations. To the best of our knowledge, no network-based ranking algorithm is able to handle multidimensional networks and multiple rankings over multiple attributes at the same time. In this paper we propose such an algorithm, whose aim is to address the node multi-ranking problem in multidimensional networks. We test our algorithm over several real world networks, extracted from DBLP and the Enron email corpus, and we show its usefulness in providing less trivial and more flexible rankings than the current state of the art algorithms.</data>

      <data key="title">towards effective visual analytics on multiplex and multilayer networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this article we discuss visualisation strategies for multiplex networks. Since Moreno's early works on network analysis, visualisation has been one of the main ways to understand networks thanks to its ability to summarise a complex structure into a single representation highlighting multiple properties of the data. However, despite the large renewed interest in the analysis of multiplex networks, no study has proposed specialised visualisation approaches for this context and traditional methods are typically applied instead. In this paper we initiate a critical and structured discussion of this topic, and claim that the development of specific visualisation methods for multiplex networks will be one of the main drivers pushing current research results into daily practice.</data>

      <data key="title">a method for group extraction and analysis in multilayer social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">The main subject studied in this dissertation is a multi-layered social network (MSN) and its analysis. One of the crucial problems in multi-layered social network analysis is community extraction. To cope with this problem the CLECC measure (Cross Layered Edge Clustering Coefficient) was proposed in the thesis. It is an edge measure which expresses how much the neighbors of two given users are similar each other. Based on this measure the CLECC algorithm for community extraction in the multi-layered social networks was designed. The algorithm was tested on the real single-layered social networks (SSN) and multi-layered social networks (MSN), as well as on benchmark networks from GN Benchmark (SSN), LFR Benchmark (SSN) and mLFR Benchmark (MSN) a special extension of LFR Benchmark, designed as a part of this thesis, which is able to produce multi-layered benchmark networks. The second research problem considered in the thesis was group evolution discovery. Studies on this problem have led to the development of the inclusion measure and the Group Evolution Discovery (GED) method, which is designed to identify events between two groups in successive time frames in the social network. The method was tested on a real social network and compared with two well-known algorithms regarding accuracy, execution time, flexibility and ease of implementation. Finally, a new approach to prediction of group evolution in the social network was developed. The new approach involves usage of the outputs of the GED method. It is shown, that using even a simple sequence, which consists of several preceding groups sizes and events, as an input for the classifier, the learned model can produce very good results also for simple classifiers.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The digital exhaust left by flows of physical and digital commodities provides a rich measure of the nature, strength and significance of relationships between countries in the global network. With this work, we examine how these traces and the network structure can reveal the socioeconomic profile of different countries. We take into account multiple international networks of physical and digital flows, including the previously unexplored international postal network. By measuring the position of each country in the Trade, Postal, Migration, International Flights, IP and Digital Communications networks, we are able to build proxies for a number of crucial socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita and the Human Development Index ranking along with twelve other indicators used as benchmarks of national well-being by the United Nations and other international organisations. In this context, we have also proposed and evaluated a global connectivity degree measure applying multiplex theory across the six networks that accounts for the strength of relationships between countries. We conclude by showing how countries with shared community membership over multiple networks have similar socioeconomic profiles. Combining multiple flow data sources can help understand the forces which drive economic activity on a global level. Such an ability to infer proxy indicators in a context of incomplete information is extremely timely in light of recent discussions on measurement of indicators relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals.</data>

      <data key="title">principled multilayer network embedding</data>
      <data key="abstract">Multilayer network analysis has become a vital tool for understanding different relationships and their interactions in a complex system, where each layer in a multilayer network depicts the topological structure of a group of nodes corresponding to a particular relationship. The interactions among different layers imply how the interplay of different relations on the topology of each layer. For a single-layer network, network embedding methods have been proposed to project the nodes in a network into a continuous vector space with a relatively small number of dimensions, where the space embeds the social representations among nodes. These algorithms have been proved to have a better performance on a variety of regular graph analysis tasks, such as link prediction, or multi-label classification. In this paper, by extending a standard graph mining into multilayer network, we have proposed three methods ("network aggregation," "results aggregation" and "layer co-analysis") to project a multilayer network into a continuous vector space. From the evaluation, we have proved that comparing with regular link prediction methods, "layer co-analysis" achieved the best performance on most of the datasets, while "network aggregation" and "results aggregation" also have better performance than regular link prediction methods.</data>

      <data key="title">shortest path discovery in the multi layered social network</data>
      <data key="abstract">Multi-layered social networks consist of the fixed set of nodes linked by multiple connections. These connections may be derived from different types of user activities logged in the IT system. To calculate any structural measures for multi-layered networks this multitude of relations should be coped with in the parameterized way. Two separate algorithms for evaluation of shortest paths in the multi-layered social network are proposed in the paper. The first one is based on pre-processing -- aggregation of multiple links into single multi-layered edges, whereas in the second approach, many edges are processed 'on the fly' in the middle of path discovery. Experimental studies carried out on the DBLP database are presented as well.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Scholars, advertisers and political activists see massive online social networks as a representation of social interactions that can be used to study the propagation of ideas, social bond dynamics and viral marketing, among others. But the linked structures of social networks do not reveal actual interactions among people. Scarcity of attention and the daily rythms of life and work makes people default to interacting with those few that matter and that reciprocate their attention. A study of social interactions within Twitter reveals that the driver of usage is a sparse and hidden network of connections underlying the declared set of friends and followers.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The general pupose of the scholarly communication process is to support the creation and dissemination of ideas within the scientific community. At a finer granularity, there exists multiple stages which, when confronted by a member of the community, have different requirements and therefore different solutions. In order to take a researcher's idea from an initial inspiration to a community resource, the scholarly communication infrastructure may be required to 1) provide a scientist initial seed ideas; 2) form a team of well suited collaborators; 3) located the most appropriate venue to publish the formalized idea; 4) determine the most appropriate peers to review the manuscript; and 5) disseminate the end product to the most interested members of the community. Through the various delinieations of this process, the requirements of each stage are tied soley to the multi-functional resources of the community: its researchers, its journals, and its manuscritps. It is within the collection of these resources and their inherent relationships that the solutions to scholarly communication are to be found. This paper describes an associative network composed of multiple scholarly artifacts that can be used as a medium for supporting the scholarly communication process.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Studying information diffusion and the spread of goods in the real world and in many digital services can be extremely difficult since information about the information flows is challenging to accurately track. How information spreads has commonly been analysed from the perspective of homophily, social influence, and initial seed selection. However, in virtual worlds and virtual economies, the movements of information and goods can be precisely tracked. Therefore, these environments create laboratories for the accurate study of information diffusion characteristics that have been difficult to study in prior research. In this paper, we study how content visibility as well as sender and receiver characteristics, the relationship between them, and the types of multilayer social network layers affect content absorption and diffusion in virtual world. The results show that prior visibility of distributed content is the strongest predictor of content adoption and its further spread across networks. Among other analysed factors, the mechanics of diffusion, content quality, and content adoption by users’ neighbours on the social activity layer had very strong influences on the adoption of new content.</data>

      <data key="title">multi layered social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">It is quite obvious that in the real world, more than one kind of relationship can exist between two actors and that those ties can be so intertwined that it is impossible to analyse them separately [Fienberg 85], [Minor 83], [Szell 10]. Social networks with more than one type of relation are not a completely new concept [Wasserman 94] but they were analysed mainly at the small scale, e.g. in [McPherson 01], [Padgett 93], and [Entwisle 07]. Just like in the case of regular single-layered social network there is no widely accepted definition or even common name. At the beginning such networks have been called multiplex network [Haythornthwaite 99], [Monge 03]. The term is derived from communications theory which defines multiplex as combining multiple signals into one in such way that it is possible to separate them if needed [Hamill 06]. Recently, the area of multi-layered social network has started attracting more and more attention in research conducted within different domains [Kazienko 11a], [Szell 10], [Rodriguez 07], [Rodriguez 09], and the meaning of multiplex network has expanded and covers not only social relationships but any kind of connection, e.g. based on geography, occupation, kinship, hobbies, etc. [Abraham 12]. This essay aims to summarize existing knowledge about one concept which has many different names i.e. the concept of Multi-layered Social Network also known as Layered social network, Multi-relational social network, Multidimensional social network, Multiplex social network</data>

      <data key="title">low distortion inference of latent similarities from a multiplex social network</data>
      <data key="abstract">Much of social network analysis is - implicitly or explicitly - predicated on the assumption that individuals tend to be more similar to their friends than to strangers. Thus, an observed social network provides a noisy signal about the latent underlying "social space:" the way in which individuals are similar or dissimilar. Many research questions frequently addressed via social network analysis are in reality questions about this social space, raising the question of inverting the process: Given a social network, how accurately can we reconstruct the social structure of similarities and dissimilarities? #R##N#We begin to address this problem formally. Observed social networks are usually multiplex, in the sense that they reflect (dis)similarities in several different "categories," such as geographical proximity, kinship, or similarity of professions/hobbies. We assume that each such category is characterized by a latent metric capturing (dis)similarities in this category. Each category gives rise to a separate social network: a random graph parameterized by this metric. For a concrete model, we consider Kleinberg's small world model and some variations thereof. The observed social network is the unlabeled union of these graphs, i.e., the presence or absence of edges can be observed, but not their origins. Our main result is an algorithm which reconstructs each metric with provably low distortion.</data>

      <data key="title">hierarchical stochastic block model for community detection in multiplex networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Multiplex networks have become increasingly more prevalent in many fields, and have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the complexity of real networks. There is a critical need for developing inference models for multiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across different layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. We add to a limited literature by proposing a novel and efficient Bayesian model for community detection in multiplex networks. A key feature of our approach is the ability to model varying communities at different network layers. In contrast, many existing models assume the same communities for all layers. Moreover, our model automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer (as validated by real data examples). This is appealing, since deciding the number of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and especially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change across layers. Borrowing ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we use a hierarchical Dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing dependency in their structure. Given the community labels, a stochastic block model (SBM) is assumed for each layer. We develop an efficient slice sampler for sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the link probabilities between communities. In doing so, we address some unique challenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of SBM with the hierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. An extensive empirical validation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior performance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability to uncover interesting structures in real networks.</data>

      <data key="title">extraction of multilayered social networks from activity data</data>
      <data key="abstract">The data gathered in all kinds of web-based systems, which enable users to interact with each other, provides an opportunity to extract social networks that consist of people and relationships between them. The emerging structures are very complex due to the number and type of discovered connections. In web-based systems, the characteristic element of each interaction between users is that there is always an object that serves as a communication medium. This can be, for example, an e-mail sent from one user to another or post at the forum authored by one user and commented on by others. Based on these objects and activities that users perform towards them, different kinds of relationships can be identified and extracted. Additional challenge arises from the fact that hierarchies can exist between objects; for example, a forum consists of one or more groups of topics, and each of them contains topics that finally include posts. In this paper, we propose a new method for creation of multilayered social network based on the data about users activities towards different types of objects between which the hierarchy exists. Due to the flattening, preprocessing procedure of new layers and new relationships in the multilayered social network can be identified and analysed.</data>

      <data key="title">exposing multi relational networks to single relational network analysis algorithms</data>
      <data key="abstract">Many, if not most network analysis algorithms have been designed specifically for single-relational networks; that is, networks in which all edges are of the same type. For example, edges may either represent “friendship,” “kinship,” or “collaboration,” but not all of them together. In contrast, a multi-relational network is a network with a heterogeneous set of edge labels which can represent relationships of various types in a single data structure. While multi-relational networks are more expressive in terms of the variety of relationships they can capture, there is a need for a general framework for transferring the many single-relational network analysis algorithms to the multi-relational domain. It is not sufficient to execute a single-relational network analysis algorithm on a multi-relational network by simply ignoring edge labels. This article presents an algebra for mapping multi-relational networks to single-relational networks, thereby exposing them to single-relational network analysis algorithms.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Abstract Social networks existing among employees, customers or other types of users of various IT systems have become one of the research areas of growing importance. Data about people and their interactions that exist in social media, provides information about many different types of relationships within one network. Analysing this data one can obtain knowledge not only about the structure and characteristics of the network but it also enables to understand the semantic of human relations. Each social network consists of nodes – social entities and edges linking pairs of nodes. In regular, one-layered networks, two nodes – i.e. people are connected with a single edge whereas in the multi-layered social networks, there may be many links of different types for a pair of nodes. Most of the methods used for social network analysis (SNA) may be applied only to one-layered networks. Thus, some new structural measures for multi-layered social networks are proposed in the paper.

      <data key="title">a classification for community discovery methods in complex networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Many real-world networks are intimately organized according to a community structure. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms that can efficiently highlight this hidden structure of a network, yielding a vast literature on what is called today community detection. Since network representation can be very complex and can contain different variants in the traditional graph model, each algorithm in the literature focuses on some of these properties and establishes, explicitly or implicitly, its own definition of community. According to this definition, each proposed algorithm then extracts the communities, which typically reflect only part of the features of real communities. The aim of this survey is to provide a ‘user manual’ for the community discovery problem. Given a meta definition of what a community in a social network is, our aim is to organize the main categories of community discovery methods based on the definition of community they adopt. Given a desired definition of community and the features of a problem (size of network, direction of edges, multidimensionality, and so on) this review paper is designed to provide a set of approaches that researchers could focus on. The proposed classification of community discovery methods is also useful for putting into perspective the many open directions for further research. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      <data key="title">multidimensional social network in the social recommender system</data>
      <data key="abstract">All online sharing systems gather data that reflects users' collective behavior and their shared activities. This data can be used to extract different kinds of relationships which can be grouped into layers and which are basic components of the multidimensional social network (MSN) proposed in the paper. The layers are created on the basis of two types of relations between humans, i.e., direct and object-based ones which, respectively, correspond to either social or semantic links between individuals. For better understanding of the complexity of the social network structure, layers and their profiles were identified and studied on two, spanned in time, snapshots of the `Flickr' population. Additionally, for each layer, a separate strength measure was proposed. The experiments on the `Flickr' photo sharing system revealed that the relationships between users result either from semantic links between objects they operate on or from social connections of these users. Moreover, the density of the social network increases in time. The second part of this paper is devoted to building a social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations between users in a multimedia sharing system. Its main goal is to generate personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted to users' needs depending on the personal weights assigned to each layer in the MSN. The conducted experiments confirmed the usefulness of the proposed model.</data>
