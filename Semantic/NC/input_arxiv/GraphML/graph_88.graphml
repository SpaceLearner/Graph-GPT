      <data key="title">network function virtualization state of the art and research challenges</data>
      <data key="abstract">Network function virtualization (NFV) has drawn significant attention from both industry and academia as an important shift in telecommunication service provisioning. By decoupling network functions (NFs) from the physical devices on which they run, NFV has the potential to lead to significant reductions in operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expenses (CAPEX) and facilitate the deployment of new services with increased agility and faster time-to-value. The NFV paradigm is still in its infancy and there is a large spectrum of opportunities for the research community to develop new architectures, systems and applications, and to evaluate alternatives and trade-offs in developing technologies for its successful deployment. In this paper, after discussing NFV and its relationship with complementary fields of software defined networking (SDN) and cloud computing, we survey the state-of-the-art in NFV, and identify promising research directions in this area. We also overview key NFV projects, standardization efforts, early implementations, use cases, and commercial products.</data>

      <data key="title">energy efficient and resilient infrastructure for fog computing health monitoring applications</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we propose a resilient energy efficient and fog computing infrastructure for health monitoring applications. We design the infrastructure to be resilient against server failures under two scenarios; without geographical constraints and with geographical constraints. We consider a heart monitoring application where patients send their 30-seconds recording of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for processing, analysis and decision making at both primary and backup servers. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is used to optimize the number and locations of the primary and backup processing servers so that the energy consumption of both the processing and networking equipment are minimized. The results show that considering geographical constraints yields a network energy consumption increase by up to 9% compared to without geographical constraint. The results also show that, increasing the number of processing servers that can be served at each candidate node can reduce the energy consumption of networking equipment besides reducing the rate of energy increase of networking equipment due to increasing level of demand.</data>

      <data key="abstract">As a promising paradigm to reduce both capital and operating expenditures, the cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has been shown to provide high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Motivated by its significant theoretical performance gains and potential advantages, C-RANs have been advocated by both the industry and research community. This paper comprehensively surveys the recent advances of C-RANs, including system architectures, key techniques, and open issues. The system architectures with different functional splits and the corresponding characteristics are comprehensively summarized and discussed. The state-of-the-art key techniques in C-RANs are classified as: the fronthaul compression, large-scale collaborative processing, and channel estimation in the physical layer; and the radio resource allocation and optimization in the upper layer. Additionally, given the extensiveness of the research area, open issues and challenges are presented to spur future investigations, in which the involvement of edge cache, big data mining, social-aware device-to-device, cognitive radio, software defined network, and physical layer security for C-RANs are discussed, and the progress of testbed development and trial test are introduced as well.</data>

      <data key="title">datacenter traffic control understanding techniques and tradeoffs</data>
      <data key="abstract">Datacenters provide cost-effective and flexible access to scalable compute and storage resources necessary for today’s cloud computing needs. A typical datacenter is made up of thousands of servers connected with a large network and usually managed by one operator. To provide quality access to the variety of applications and services hosted on datacenters and maximize performance, it deems necessary to use datacenter networks effectively and efficiently. Datacenter traffic is often a mix of several classes with different priorities and requirements. This includes user-generated interactive traffic, traffic with deadlines, and long-running traffic. To this end, custom transport protocols and traffic management techniques have been developed to improve datacenter network performance. In this tutorial paper, we review the general architecture of datacenter networks, various topologies proposed for them, their traffic properties, general traffic control challenges in datacenters and general traffic control objectives. The purpose of this paper is to bring out the important characteristics of traffic control in datacenters and not to survey all existing solutions (as it is virtually impossible due to massive body of existing research). We hope to provide readers with a wide range of options and factors while considering a variety of traffic control mechanisms. We discuss various characteristics of datacenter traffic control, including management schemes, transmission control, traffic shaping, prioritization, load balancing, multipathing, and traffic scheduling. Next, we point to several open challenges as well as new and interesting networking paradigms. At the end of this paper, we briefly review inter-datacenter networks that connect geographically dispersed datacenters, which have been receiving increasing attention recently and pose interesting and novel research problems. To measure the performance of datacenter networks, different performance metrics have been used, such as flow completion times, deadline miss rate, throughput, and fairness. Depending on the application and user requirements, some metrics may need more attention. While investigating different traffic control techniques, we point out the tradeoffs involved in terms of costs, complexity, and performance. We find that a combination of different traffic control techniques may be necessary at particular entities and layers in the network to improve the variety of performance metrics. We also find that despite significant research efforts, there are still open problems that demand further attention from the research community.</data>

      <data key="title">mobile edge computing a survey on architecture and computation offloading</data>
      <data key="abstract">Technological evolution of mobile user equipment (UEs), such as smartphones or laptops, goes hand-in-hand with evolution of new mobile applications. However, running computationally demanding applications at the UEs is constrained by limited battery capacity and energy consumption of the UEs. A suitable solution extending the battery life-time of the UEs is to offload the applications demanding huge processing to a conventional centralized cloud. Nevertheless, this option introduces significant execution delay consisting of delivery of the offloaded applications to the cloud and back plus time of the computation at the cloud. Such a delay is inconvenient and makes the offloading unsuitable for real-time applications. To cope with the delay problem, a new emerging concept, known as mobile edge computing (MEC), has been introduced. The MEC brings computation and storage resources to the edge of mobile network enabling it to run the highly demanding applications at the UE while meeting strict delay requirements. The MEC computing resources can be exploited also by operators and third parties for specific purposes. In this paper, we first describe major use cases and reference scenarios where the MEC is applicable. After that we survey existing concepts integrating MEC functionalities to the mobile networks and discuss current advancement in standardization of the MEC. The core of this survey is, then, focused on user-oriented use case in the MEC, i.e., computation offloading. In this regard, we divide the research on computation offloading to three key areas: 1) decision on computation offloading; 2) allocation of computing resource within the MEC; and 3) mobility management. Finally, we highlight lessons learned in area of the MEC and we discuss open research challenges yet to be addressed in order to fully enjoy potentials offered by the MEC.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Compared with fourth generation cellular systems, fifth generation wireless communication systems are anticipated to provide spectral and energy efficiency growth by a factor of at least 10, and the area throughput growth by a factor of at least 25. To achieve these goals, a H-CRAN is presented in this article as the advanced wireless access network paradigm, where cloud computing is used to fulfill the centralized large-scale cooperative processing for suppressing co-channel interferences. The state-of-the-art research achievements in the areas of system architecture and key technologies for H-CRANs are surveyed. Particularly, Node C as a new communication entity is defined to converge the existing ancestral base stations and act as the base band unit pool to manage all accessed remote radio heads. Also, the software-defined H-CRAN system architecture is presented to be compatible with software-defined networks. The principles, performance gains, and open issues of key technologies, including adaptive large-scale cooperative spatial signal processing, cooperative radio resource management, network function virtualization, and self-organization, are summarized. The major challenges in terms of fronthaul constrained resource allocation optimization and energy harvesting that may affect the promotion of H-CRANs are discussed as well.</data>

      <data key="title">greendcn a general framework for achieving energy efficiency in data center networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">The popularization of cloud computing has raised concerns over the energy consumption that takes place in data centers. In addition to the energy consumed by servers, the energy consumed by large numbers of network devices emerges as a significant problem. Existing work on energy-efficient data center networking primarily focuses on traffic engineering, which is usually adapted from traditional networks. We propose a new framework to embrace the new opportunities brought by combining some special features of data centers with traffic engineering. Based on this framework, we characterize the problem of achieving energy efficiency with a time-aware model, and we prove its NP-hardness with a solution that has two steps. First, we solve the problem of assigning virtual machines (VM) to servers to reduce the amount of traffic and to generate favorable conditions for traffic engineering. The solution reached for this problem is based on three essential principles that we propose. Second, we reduce the number of active switches and balance traffic flows, depending on the relation between power consumption and routing, to achieve energy conservation. Experimental results confirm that, by using this framework, we can achieve up to 50 percent energy savings. We also provide a comprehensive discussion on the scalability and practicability of the framework.</data>

      <data key="title">a survey on geographically distributed big data processing using mapreduce</data>
      <data key="abstract">Hadoop and Spark are widely used distributed processing frameworks for large-scale data processing in an efficient and fault-tolerant manner on private or public clouds. These big-data processing systems are extensively used by many industries, e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon, for solving a large class of problems, e.g., search, clustering, log analysis, different types of join operations, matrix multiplication, pattern matching, and social network analysis. However, all these popular systems have a major drawback in terms of  locally distributed  computations, which prevent them in implementing geographically distributed data processing. The increasing amount of geographically distributed massive data is pushing industries and academia to rethink the current big-data processing systems. The novel frameworks, which will be beyond state-of-the-art architectures and technologies involved in the current system, are expected to process geographically distributed data at their locations without moving entire  raw datasets  to a single location. In this paper, we investigate and discuss challenges and requirements in designing geographically distributed data processing frameworks and protocols. We classify and study batch processing (MapReduce-based systems), stream processing (Spark-based systems), and SQL-style processing geo-distributed frameworks, models, and algorithms with their overhead issues.</data>

      <data key="title">space shuffle a scalable flexible and high performance data center network</data>
      <data key="abstract">The increasing need of cloud and big data applications requires data center networks to be scalable and bandwidth-rich. Current data center network architectures often use rigid topologies to increase network bandwidth. A major limitation is that they can hardly support incremental network growth. Recent work has been investigating new network architecture and protocols to achieve three important design goals of large data centers, namely, high throughput, routing and forwarding scalability, and flexibility for incremental growth. Unfortunately, existing data center network architectures focus on one or two of the above properties and pay little attention to the others. In this paper, we design a novel flexible data center network architecture, Space Shuffle (S2), which applies greedy routing on multiple ring spaces to achieve high-throughput, scalability, and flexibility. The proposed greedy routing protocol of S2 effectively exploits the path diversity of densely connected topologies and enables key-based routing. Extensive experimental studies show that S2 provides high bisectional bandwidth and throughput, near-optimal routing path lengths, extremely small forwarding state, fairness among concurrent data flows, and resiliency to network failures.</data>

      <data key="title">a survey of big data machine learning applications optimization in cloud data centers and networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">This survey article reviews the challenges associated with deploying and optimizing big data applications and machine learning algorithms in cloud data centers and networks. The MapReduce programming model and its widely-used open-source platform; Hadoop, are enabling the development of a large number of cloud-based services and big data applications. MapReduce and Hadoop thus introduce innovative, efficient, and accelerated intensive computations and analytics. These services usually utilize commodity clusters within geographically-distributed data centers and provide cost-effective and elastic solutions. However, the increasing traffic between and within the data centers that migrate, store, and process big data, is becoming a bottleneck that calls for enhanced infrastructures capable of reducing the congestion and power consumption. Moreover, enterprises with multiple tenants requesting various big data services are challenged by the need to optimize leasing their resources at reduced running costs and power consumption while avoiding under or over utilization. In this survey, we present a summary of the characteristics of various big data programming models and applications and provide a review of cloud computing infrastructures, and related technologies such as virtualization, and software-defined networking that increasingly support big data systems. Moreover, we provide a brief review of data centers topologies, routing protocols, and traffic characteristics, and emphasize the implications of big data on such cloud data centers and their supporting networks. Wide ranging efforts were devoted to optimize systems that handle big data in terms of various applications performance metrics and/or infrastructure energy efficiency. Finally, some insights and future research directions are provided.</data>

      <data key="abstract">MapReduce is a programming system for distributed processing large-scale data in an efficient and fault tolerant manner on a private, public, or hybrid cloud. MapReduce is extensively used daily around the world as an efficient distributed computation tool for a large class of problems, e.g., search, clustering, log analysis, different types of join operations, matrix multiplication, pattern matching, and analysis of social networks. Security and privacy of data and MapReduce computations are essential concerns when a MapReduce computation is executed in public or hybrid clouds. In order to execute a MapReduce job in public and hybrid clouds, authentication of mappers-reducers, confidentiality of data-computations, integrity of data-computations, and correctness-freshness of the outputs are required. Satisfying these requirements shield the operation from several types of attacks on data and MapReduce computations. In this paper, we investigate and discuss security and privacy challenges and requirements, considering a variety of adversarial capabilities, and characteristics in the scope of MapReduce. We also provide a review of existing security and privacy protocols for MapReduce and discuss their overhead issues.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Abstract   Currently, the world is witnessing a mounting avalanche of data due to the increasing number of mobile network subscribers, Internet websites, and online services. This trend is continuing to develop in a quick and diverse manner in the form of big data. Big data analytics can process large amounts of raw data and extract useful, smaller-sized information, which can be used by different parties to make reliable decisions.  In this paper, we conduct a survey on the role that big data analytics can play in the design of data communication networks. Integrating the latest advances that employ big data analytics with the networks’ control/traffic layers might be the best way to build robust data communication networks with refined performance and intelligent features. First, the survey starts with the introduction of the big data basic concepts, framework, and characteristics. Second, we illustrate the main network design cycle employing big data analytics. This cycle represents the umbrella concept that unifies the surveyed topics. Third, there is a detailed review of the current academic and industrial efforts toward network design using big data analytics. Forth, we identify the challenges confronting the utilization of big data analytics in network design. Finally, we highlight several future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that addresses the use of big data analytics techniques for the design of a broad range of networks.</data>

      <data key="title">finishing flows quickly with preemptive scheduling</data>
      <data key="abstract">Today's data centers face extreme challenges in providing low latency. However, fair sharing, a principle commonly adopted in current congestion control protocols, is far from optimal for satisfying latency requirements. #R##N#We propose Preemptive Distributed Quick (PDQ) flow scheduling, a protocol designed to complete flows quickly and meet flow deadlines. PDQ enables flow preemption to approximate a range of scheduling disciplines. For example, PDQ can emulate a shortest job first algorithm to give priority to the short flows by pausing the contending flows. PDQ borrows ideas from centralized scheduling disciplines and implements them in a fully distributed manner, making it scalable to today's data centers. Further, we develop a multipath version of PDQ to exploit path diversity. #R##N#Through extensive packet-level and flow-level simulation, we demonstrate that PDQ significantly outperforms TCP, RCP and D3 in data center environments. We further show that PDQ is stable, resilient to packet loss, and preserves nearly all its performance gains even given inaccurate flow information.</data>

      <data key="title">energy efficient flow scheduling and routing with hard deadlines in data center networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">The power consumption of enormous network devices in data centers has emerged as a big concern to data center operators. Despite many traffic-engineering-based solutions, very little attention has been paid on performance-guaranteed energy saving schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-saving model for data center networks by scheduling and routing "deadline-constrained flows" where the transmission of every flow has to be accomplished before a rigorous deadline, being the most critical requirement in production data center networks. Based on speed scaling and power-down energy saving strategies for network devices, we aim to explore the most energy efficient way of scheduling and routing flows on the network, as well as determining the transmission speed for every flow. We consider two general versions of the problem. For the version of only flow scheduling where routes of flows are pre-given, we show that it can be solved polynomially and we develop an optimal combinatorial algorithm for it. For the version of joint flow scheduling and routing, we prove that it is strongly NP-hard and cannot have a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) unless P=NP. Based on a relaxation and randomized rounding technique, we provide an efficient approximation algorithm which can guarantee a provable performance ratio with respect to a polynomial of the total number of flows.</data>

      <data key="abstract">As mobile network users look forward to the connectivity speeds of 5G networks, service providers are facing challenges in complying with connectivity demands without substantial financial investments. Network function virtualization (NFV) is introduced as a new methodology that offers a way out of this bottleneck. NFV is poised to change the core structure of telecommunications infrastructure to be more cost-efficient. In this article, we introduce an NFV framework, and discuss the challenges and requirements of its use in mobile networks. In particular, an NFV framework in the virtual environment is proposed. Moreover, in order to reduce signaling traffic and achieve better performance, this article proposes a criterion to bundle multiple functions of a virtualized evolved packet core in a single physical device or a group of adjacent devices. The analysis shows that the proposed grouping can reduce the network control traffic by 70 percent.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The emerging software defined networking (SDN) paradigm separates the data plane from the control plane and centralizes network control in an SDN controller. Applications interact with controllers to implement network services, such as network transport with quality of service. SDN facilitates the virtualization of network functions so that multiple virtual networks can operate over a given installed physical network infrastructure. Due to the specific characteristics of optical (photonic) communication components and the high optical transmission capacities, SDN-based optical networking poses particular challenges, but holds also great potential. In this article, we comprehensively survey studies that examine the SDN paradigm in optical networks; in brief, we survey the area of software defined optical networks (SDONs). We mainly organize the SDON studies into studies focused on the infrastructure layer, the control layer, and the application layer. Moreover, we cover SDON studies focused on network virtualization, as well as SDON studies focused on the orchestration of multilayer and multidomain networking. Based on the survey, we identify open challenges for SDONs and outline future directions.</data>

      <data key="title">exploiting the power of multiplicity a holistic survey of network layer multipath</data>
      <data key="abstract">The Internet is inherently a multipath network: For an underlying network with only a single path, connecting various nodes would have been debilitatingly fragile. Unfortunately, traditional Internet technologies have been designed around the restrictive assumption of a single working path between a source and a destination. The lack of native multipath support constrains network performance even as the underlying network is richly connected and has redundant multiple paths. Computer networks can exploit the power of multiplicity, through which a diverse collection of paths is resource pooled as a single resource, to unlock the inherent redundancy of the Internet. This opens up a new vista of opportunities, promising increased throughput (through concurrent usage of multiple paths) and increased reliability and fault tolerance (through the use of multiple paths in backup/redundant arrangements). There are many emerging trends in networking that signify that the Internet's future will be multipath, including the use of multipath technology in data center computing; the ready availability of multiple heterogeneous radio interfaces in wireless (such as Wi-Fi and cellular) in wireless devices; ubiquity of mobile devices that are multihomed with heterogeneous access networks; and the development and standardization of multipath transport protocols such as multipath TCP. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature on network-layer multipath solutions. We will present a detailed investigation of two important design issues, namely, the    control plane problem   of how to compute and select the routes and the    data plane problem   of how to split the flow on the computed paths. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic articulation of the main design issues in network-layer multipath routing along with a broad-ranging survey of the vast literature on network-layer multipathing. We also highlight open issues and identify directions for future work.</data>

While it is widely known what cloud computing is, and how data centers can build the cloud infrastructure and how applications can make use of this infrastructure, there is no common picture on what fog computing and a fog node, as its main building block, really is. One of the first attempts to define a fog node was made by Cisco, qualifying a fog computing system as a mini-cloud, located at the edge of the network and implemented through a variety of edge devices, interconnected by a variety, mostly wireless, communication technologies. Thus, a fog node would be the infrastructure implementing the said mini-cloud. Other proposals have their own definition of what a fog node is, usually in relation to a specific edge device, a specific use case or an application. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art in technologies for fog computing nodes as building blocks of fog computing, paying special attention to the contributions that analyze the role edge devices play in the fog node definition. We summarize and compare the concepts, lessons learned from their implementation, and show how a conceptual framework is emerging towards a unifying fog node definition. We focus on core functionalities of a fog node as well as in the accompanying opportunities and challenges towards their practical realization in the near future.</data>
