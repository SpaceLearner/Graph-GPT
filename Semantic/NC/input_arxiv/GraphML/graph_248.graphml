      <data key="title">do deep nets really need to be deep</data>
      <data key="abstract">Currently, deep neural networks are the state of the art on problems such as speech recognition and computer vision. In this extended abstract, we show that shallow feed-forward networks can learn the complex functions previously learned by deep nets and achieve accuracies previously only achievable with deep models. Moreover, in some cases the shallow neural nets can learn these deep functions using a total number of parameters similar to the original deep model. We evaluate our method on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task and are able to train shallow fully-connected nets that perform similarly to complex, well-engineered, deep convolutional architectures. Our success in training shallow neural nets to mimic deeper models suggests that there probably exist better algorithms for training shallow feed-forward nets than those currently available.</data>

      <data key="title">pattern recognition techniques for the identification of activities of daily living using mobile device accelerometer</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper focuses on the recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) applying pattern recognition techniques to the data acquired by the accelerometer available in the mobile devices. The recognition of ADL is composed by several stages, including data acquisition, data processing, and artificial intelligence methods. The artificial intelligence methods used are related to pattern recognition, and this study focuses on the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The data processing includes data cleaning, and the feature extraction techniques to define the inputs for the ANN. Due to the low processing power and memory of the mobile devices, they should be mainly used to acquire the data, applying an ANN previously trained for the identification of the ADL. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new method implemented with ANN for the identification of a defined set of ADL with a reliable accuracy. This paper also presents a comparison of different types of ANN in order to choose the type for the implementation of the final method. Results of this research probes that the best accuracies are achieved with Deep Learning techniques with an accuracy higher than 80%.</data>

      <data key="title">person identification based on hand tremor characteristics</data>
      <data key="abstract">A plethora of biometric measures have been proposed in the past. In this paper we introduce a new potential biometric measure: the human tremor. We present a new method for identifying the user of a handheld device using characteristics of the hand tremor measured with a smartphone built-in inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). The main challenge of the proposed method is related to the fact that human normal tremor is very subtle while we aim to address real-life scenarios. To properly address the issue, we have relied on weighted Fourier linear combiner for retrieving only the tremor data from the hand movement and random forest for actual recognition. We have evaluated our method on a database with 10 000 samples from 17 persons reaching an accuracy of 76%.</data>

      <data key="title">user environment detection with acoustic sensors embedded on mobile devices for the recognition of activities of daily living</data>
      <data key="abstract">The detection of the environment where user is located, is of extreme use for the identification of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). ADL can be identified by use of the sensors available in many off-the-shelf mobile devices, including magnetic and motion, and the environment can be also identified using acoustic sensors. The study presented in this paper is divided in two parts: firstly, we discuss the recognition of the environment using acoustic sensors (i.e., microphone), and secondly, we fuse this information with motion and magnetic sensors (i.e., motion and magnetic sensors) for the recognition of standing activities of daily living. The recognition of the environments and the ADL are performed using pattern recognition techniques, in order to develop a system that includes data acquisition, data processing, data fusion, and artificial intelligence methods. The artificial intelligence methods explored in this study are composed by different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), comparing the different types of ANN and selecting the best methods to implement in the different stages of the system developed. Conclusions point to the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with normalized data for the identification of ADL with 85.89% of accuracy, the use of Feedforward neural networks with non-normalized data for the identification of the environments with 86.50% of accuracy, and the use of DNN with normalized data for the identification of standing activities with 100% of accuracy.</data>

      <data key="title">stealing pins via mobile sensors actual risk versus user perception</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we present the actual risks of stealing user PINs by using mobile sensors versus the perceived risks by users. First, we propose PINlogger.js which is a JavaScript-based side channel attack revealing user PINs on an Android mobile phone. In this attack, once the user visits a website controlled by an attacker, the JavaScript code embedded in the web page starts listening to the motion and orientation sensor streams without needing any permission from the user. By analysing these streams, it infers the user’s PIN using an artificial neural network. Based on a test set of fifty 4-digit PINs, PINlogger.js is able to correctly identify PINs in the first attempt with a success rate of 74% which increases to 86 and 94% in the second and third attempts, respectively. The high success rates of stealing user PINs on mobile devices via JavaScript indicate a serious threat to user security. With the technical understanding of the information leakage caused by mobile phone sensors, we then study users’ perception of the risks associated with these sensors. We design user studies to measure the general familiarity with different sensors and their functionality, and to investigate how concerned users are about their PIN being discovered by an app that has access to all these sensors. Our studies show that there is significant disparity between the actual and perceived levels of threat with regard to the compromise of the user PIN. We confirm our results by interviewing our participants using two different approaches, within-subject and between-subject, and compare the results. We discuss how this observation, along with other factors, renders many academic and industry solutions ineffective in preventing such side channel attacks.</data>

      <data key="title">on the security and applicability of fragile camera fingerprints</data>
      <data key="abstract">Camera sensor noise is one of the most reliable device characteristics in digital image forensics, enabling the unique linkage of images to digital cameras. This so-called camera fingerprint gives rise to different applications, such as image forensics and authentication. However, if images are publicly available, an adversary can estimate the fingerprint from her victim and plant it into spurious images. The concept of fragile camera fingerprints addresses this attack by exploiting asymmetries in data access: While the camera owner will always have access to a full fingerprint from uncompressed images, the adversary has typically access to compressed images and thus only to a truncated fingerprint. The security of this defense, however, has not been systematically explored yet. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of fragile camera fingerprints under attack. A series of theoretical and practical tests demonstrate that fragile camera fingerprints allow a reliable device identification for common compression levels in an adversarial environment.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The scheme of application (app) distribution systems involving incentivized third-party app vendors is a desirable option for the emerging edge computing systems. However, such a scheme also brings various security challenges as faced by the current mobile app distribution systems. In this paper, we study a threat named covert device association, in which the vendors of two apps collude to figure out which of their app installations run on the same edge device. If the two colluding apps are popular, the threat can be used to launch various types of further attacks at scale. For example, the user of the compromised edge device, who wishes to remain anonymous to one of the two apps, will be de-anonymized if the user is not anonymous to the other app...</data>

      <data key="title">powerspy location tracking using mobile device power analysis</data>
      <data key="abstract">Modern mobile platforms like Android enable applications to read aggregate power usage on the phone. This information is considered harmless and reading it requires no user permission or notification. We show that by simply reading the phone's aggregate power consumption over a period of a few minutes an application can learn information about the user's location. Aggregate phone power consumption data is extremely noisy due to the multitude of components and applications that simultaneously consume power. Nevertheless, by using machine learning algorithms we are able to successfully infer the phone's location. We discuss several ways in which this privacy leak can be remedied.</data>

      <data key="title">you are your metadata identification and obfuscation of social media users using metadata information</data>
      <data key="abstract">Metadata are associated to most of the information we produce in our daily interactions and communication in the digital world. Yet, surprisingly, metadata are often still catergorized as non-sensitive. Indeed, in the past, researchers and practitioners have mainly focused on the problem of the identification of a user from the content of a message. #R##N#In this paper, we use Twitter as a case study to quantify the uniqueness of the association between metadata and user identity and to understand the effectiveness of potential obfuscation strategies. More specifically, we analyze atomic fields in the metadata and systematically combine them in an effort to classify new tweets as belonging to an account using different machine learning algorithms of increasing complexity. We demonstrate that through the application of a supervised learning algorithm, we are able to identify any user in a group of 10,000 with approximately 96.7% accuracy. Moreover, if we broaden the scope of our search and consider the 10 most likely candidates we increase the accuracy of the model to 99.22%. We also found that data obfuscation is hard and ineffective for this type of data: even after perturbing 60% of the training data, it is still possible to classify users with an accuracy higher than 95%. These results have strong implications in terms of the design of metadata obfuscation strategies, for example for data set release, not only for Twitter, but, more generally, for most social media platforms.</data>

      <data key="title">systematic classification of side channel attacks a case study for mobile devices</data>
      <data key="abstract">Side-channel attacks on mobile devices have gained increasing attention since their introduction in 2007. While traditional side-channel attacks, such as power analysis attacks and electromagnetic analysis attacks, required physical presence of the attacker as well as expensive equipment, an (unprivileged) application is all it takes to exploit the leaking information on modern mobile devices. Given the vast amount of sensitive information that are stored on smartphones, the ramifications of side-channel attacks affect both the security and privacy of users and their devices. In this paper, we propose a new categorization system for side-channel attacks, which is necessary as side-channel attacks have evolved significantly since their scientific investigations during the smart card era in the 1990s. Our proposed classification system allows to analyze side-channel attacks systematically, and facilitates the development of novel countermeasures. Besides this new categorization system, the extensive survey of existing attacks and attack strategies provides valuable insights into the evolving field of side-channel attacks, especially when focusing on mobile devices. We conclude by discussing open issues and challenges in this context and outline possible future research directions.</data>

      <data key="abstract">IP headers include a 16-bit ID field. Our work examines the generation of this field in Windows (versions 8 and higher), Linux and Android, and shows that the IP ID field enables remote servers to assign a unique ID to each device and thus be able to identify subsequent transmissions sent from that device. This identification works across all browsers and over network changes. In modern Linux and Android versions, this field leaks a kernel address, thus we also break KASLR. #R##N#Our work includes reverse-engineering of the Windows IP ID generation code, and a cryptanalysis of this code and of the Linux kernel IP ID generation code. It provides practical techniques to partially extract the key used by each of these algorithms, overcoming different implementation issues, and observing that this key can identify individual devices. We deployed a demo (for Windows) showing that key extraction and machine fingerprinting works in the wild, and tested it from networks around the world.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This report provides an overview of the current state of the art deep learning architectures and optimisation techniques, and uses the ADNI hippocampus MRI dataset as an example to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of different convolutional architectures on the task of patch-based 3-dimensional hippocampal segmentation, which is important in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. We found that a slightly unconventional "stacked 2D" approach provides much better classification performance than simple 2D patches without requiring significantly more computational power. We also examined the popular "tri-planar" approach used in some recently published studies, and found that it provides much better results than the 2D approaches, but also with a moderate increase in computational power requirement. Finally, we evaluated a full 3D convolutional architecture, and found that it provides marginally better results than the tri-planar approach, but at the cost of a very significant increase in computational power requirement.</data>

      <data key="title">identifying ecus using inimitable characteristics of signals in controller area networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In the last several decades, the automotive industry has come to incorporate the latest Information and Communications (ICT) technology, increasingly replacing mechanical components of vehicles with electronic components. These electronic control units (ECUs) communicate with each other in an in-vehicle network that makes the vehicle both safer and easier to drive. Controller Area Networks (CANs) are the current standard for such high quality in-vehicle communication. Unfortunately, however, CANs do not currently offer protection against security attacks. In particular, they do not allow for message authentication and hence are open to attacks that replay ECU messages for malicious purposes. Applying the classic cryptographic method of message authentication code (MAC) is not feasible since the CAN data frame is not long enough to include a sufficiently long MAC to provide effective authentication. In this paper, we propose a novel identification method, which works in the physical layer of an in-vehicle CAN network. Our method identifies ECUs using inimitable characteristics of signals enabling detection of a compromised or alien ECU being used in a replay attack. Unlike previous attempts to address security issues in the in-vehicle CAN network, our method works by simply adding a monitoring unit to the existing network, making it deployable in current systems and compliant with required CAN standards. Our experimental results show that the bit string and classification algorithm that we utilized yielded more accurate identification of compromised ECUs than any other method proposed to date. The false positive rate is more than 2 times lower than the method proposed by P.-S. Murvay et al. This paper is also the first to identify potential attack models that systems should be able to detect.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Nowadays privacy in the connected world is a big user's concern. The ubiquity of mobile devices permits billions of users browse the web at anytime, anywhere. Near Field Communication (NFC) appeared as a seamlessly and simply communication protocol between devices. Commercial services such as Android Pay, and Apple Pay offer contactless payment methods that are spreading in more and more scenarios. However, we take risks while using NFC on Android devices, we can be hacked, and our privacy can be affected. In this paper we study the current vulnerabilities in the NFC-Android ecosystem. We conduct a series of experiments and we expose that with NFC and Android devices are vulnerable to URL/URI spoofing, Bank/social network information hacking, and user's device tracking via fingerprint and geo-location. It is important for the community to understand the problem and come up solution that can tackle these issues and inform the users about privacy awareness and risks on using these contactless services.</data>

      <data key="title">analysis of applicability of iso 9564 pin based authentication to closed loop mobile payment systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Payment transactions initiated through a mobile device are growing and security concerns must be ad-dressed. People coming from payment card industry often talk passionately about porting ISO 9564 PIN standard based authentication in open-loop card payment to closed-loop mobile financial transactions and certification of closed-loop payment product or solution against this standard. In reality, so far this standard has not been adopted in closed-loop mobile payment authentication and applicability of this ISO standard must be studied carefully before adoption. The authors do a critical analysis of the applicability of this ISO specification and makes categorical statement about relevance of compliance to closed-loop mobile payment. Security requirements for authentication in closed-loop mobile payment systems are not standardized through ISO 9564 standard, Common Criteria, etc. Since closed-loop mobile payment is a relatively new field, the authors make a case for Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA) or other standards organization to push for publication of a mobile device-agnostic Protection Profile or standard for it, incorporating the suggested authentication approaches.</data>

This motivates us, herein, to provide the first detailed exploration of the integration of a fundamentally different element of defense into the design of web authentication schemes: a mimicry resistance dimension. We analyze web authentication mechanisms with respect to new properties related to mimicry-resistance, and in particular evaluate invisible techniques that provide some mimicry-resistance (unlike those relying solely on static secrets), including device fingerprinting schemes, PUFs (physically unclonable functions), and a subset of Internet geolocation mechanisms.</data>

      <data key="title">mobile device identification via sensor fingerprinting</data>
      <data key="abstract">We demonstrate how the multitude of sensors on a smartphone can be used to construct a reliable hardware fingerprint of the phone. Such a fingerprint can be used to de-anonymize mobile devices as they connect to web sites, and as a second factor in identifying legitimate users to a remote server. We present two implementations: one based on analyzing the frequency response of the speakerphone-microphone system, and another based on analyzing device-specific accelerometer calibration errors. Our accelerometer-based fingerprint is especially interesting because the accelerometer is accessible via JavaScript running in a mobile web browser without requesting any permissions or notifying the user. We present the results of the most extensive sensor fingerprinting experiment done to date, which measured sensor properties from over 10,000 mobile devices. We show that the entropy from sensor fingerprinting is sufficient to uniquely identify a device among thousands of devices, with low probability of collision.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Wallet may be described as container application used for configuring, accessing and analysing data from underlying payment application(s). There are two dominant types of digital wallet applications, proximity wallet and remote wallet. In the payment industry, one often hears about authentication approach for proximity or remote wallets or the underlying payment applications separately, but there is no such approach, as per our knowledge, for combined wallet, the holder application. While Secure Element (SE) controlled by the mobile network operator (i.e., SIM card) may ensure strong authentication, it introduces strong dependencies among business partners in payments and hence is not getting fraction. Embedded SE in the form of trusted execution environment [3, 4, 5] or trusted computing [24] may address this issue in future. But such devices tend to be a bit expensive and are not abundant in the market. Meanwhile, for many years, context based authentication involving device fingerprinting and other contextual information for conditional multi-factor authentication, would prevail and would remain as the most dominant and strong authentication mechanism for mobile devices from various vendors in different capability and price ranges. EMVCo payment token standard published in 2014 tries to address security of wallet based payment in a general way. The authors believe that it is quite likely that EMVCo payment token implementations would evolve in course of time in such a way that token service providers would start insisting on device fingerprinting as strong means of authentication before issuing one-time-use payment token. This paper talks about challenges of existing authentication mechanisms used in payment and wallet applications, and their evolution.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Conforming to W3C specifications, mobile web browsers allow JavaScript code in a web page to access motion and orientation sensor data without the user's permission. The associated risks to user security and privacy are however not considered in W3C specifications. In this work, for the first time, we show how user security can be compromised using these sensor data via browser, despite that the data rate is 3–5 times slower than what is available in app. We examine multiple popular browsers on Android and iOS platforms and study their policies in granting permissions to JavaScript code with respect to access to motion and orientation sensor data. Based on our observations, we identify multiple vulnerabilities, and propose TouchSignatures which implements an attack where malicious JavaScript code on an attack tab listens to such sensor data measurements. Based on these streams, TouchSignatures is able to distinguish the user's touch actions (i.e., tap, scroll, hold, and zoom) and her PINs, allowing a remote website to learn the client-side user activities. We demonstrate the practicality of this attack by collecting data from real users and reporting high success rates using our proof-of-concept implementations. We also present a set of potential solutions to address the vulnerabilities. The W3C community and major mobile browser vendors including Mozilla, Google, Apple and Opera have acknowledged our work and are implementing some of our proposed countermeasures.</data>
