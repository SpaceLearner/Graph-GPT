      <data key="title">stability theory of stochastic models in opinion dynamics</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider a certain class of nonlinear maps that preserve the probability simplex, i.e., stochastic maps, that are inspired by the DeGroot-Friedkin model of belief/opinion propagation over influence networks. The corresponding dynamical models describe the evolution of the probability distribution of interacting species. Such models where the probability transition mechanism depends nonlinearly on the current state are often referred to as {\em nonlinear Markov chains}. In this paper we develop stability results and study the behavior of representative opinion models. The stability certificates are based on the contractivity of the nonlinear evolution in the $\ell_1$-metric. We apply the theory to two types of opinion models where the adaptation of the transition probabilities to the current state is exponential and linear, respectively--both of these can display a wide range of behaviors. We discuss continuous-time and other generalizations.</data>

      <data key="title">differential dissipativity theory for dominance analysis</data>
      <data key="abstract">High-dimensional systems that have a low-dimensional dominant behavior allow for model reduction and simplified analysis. We use differential analysis to formalize this important concept in a nonlinear setting. We show that dominance can be studied through linear dissipation inequalities and an interconnection theory that closely mimics the classical analysis of stability by means of dissipativity theory. In this approach, stability is seen as the limiting situation where the dominant behavior is 0-dimensional. The generalization opens novel tractable avenues to study multistability through 1-dominance and limit cycle oscillations through 2-dominance.</data>

      <data key="title">differentiation and passivity for control of brayton moser systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper deals with a class of Resistive-Inductive-Capacitive (RLC) circuits and switched RLC (s-RLC) circuits modeled in Brayton Moser framework. For this class of systems, new passivity properties using a Krasovskii's type Lyapunov function as storage function are presented. Consequently, the supply-rate is a function of the system states, inputs and their first time-derivatives. Moreover, after showing the integrability property of the port-variables, two simple control methodologies called output shaping and input shaping are proposed for regulating the voltage in RLC and s-RLC circuits. Global asymptotic convergence to the desired operating point is theoretically proved for both proposed control methodologies. Moreover, robustness with respect to load uncertainty is ensured by the input shaping methodology. The applicability of the proposed methodologies is illustrated by designing voltage controllers for DC-DC converters and DC networks.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs) provide a nonlinear controller design involving an offline search for a Riemannian metric and an online search for a shortest path between the current and desired trajectories. In this paper, we generalize CCMs to Finsler geometry, allowing the use of non-Riemannian metrics. We provide open loop and sampled data controllers. The sampled data control construction presented here does not require real time computation of globally shortest paths, simplifying computation.</data>

      <data key="title">an internal model approach to optimal frequency regulation in power grids with time varying voltages</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper studies the problem of frequency regulation in power grids under unknown and possible time-varying load changes, while minimizing the generation costs. We formulate this problem as an output agreement problem for distribution networks and address it using incremental passivity and distributed internal-model-based controllers. Incremental passivity enables a systematic approach to study convergence to the steady state with zero frequency deviation and to design the controller in the presence of time-varying voltages, whereas the internal-model principle is applied to tackle the uncertain nature of the loads.</data>

      <data key="title">permanent magnet synchronous motors are globally asymptotically stabilizable with pi current control</data>
      <data key="abstract">This note shows that the industry standard desired equilibrium for permanent magnet synchronous motors (i.e., maximum torque per Ampere) can be globally asymptotically stabilized with a PI control around the current errors, provided some viscous friction (possibly small) is present in the rotor dynamics and the proportional gain of the PI is suitably chosen. Instrumental to establish this surprising result is the proof that the map from voltages to currents of the incremental model of the motor satisfies some passivity properties. The analysis relies on basic Lyapunov theory making the result available to a wide audience.</data>

      <data key="title">separability of lyapunov functions for contractive monotone systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider constructing Lyapunov functions for systems that are both monotone and contractive with respect to a weighted one norm or infinity norm. This class of systems admits separable Lyapunov functions that are either the sum or the maximum of a collection of functions of a single argument. In either case, two classes of separable Lyapunov functions exist: the first class is separable along the system's state, and the second class is separable along components of the system's vector field. The latter case is advantageous for many practically motivated systems for which it is difficult to measure the system's state but easier to measure the system's velocity or rate of change. We provide several examples to demonstrate our results.</data>

      <data key="title">new results on disturbance rejection for energy shaping controlled port hamiltonian systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper we present a method to robustify energy-shaping controllers for port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems by adding an integral action that rejects unknown additive disturbances. The proposed controller preserves the pH structure and, by adding to the new energy function a suitable cross term between the plant and the controller coordinates, it avoids the unnatural coordinate transformation used in the past. This paper extends our previous work by relaxing the requirement that the systems Hamiltonian is strictly convex and separable, which allows the controller to be applied to a large class of mechanical systems, including underactuated systems with non-constant mass matrix. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed integral action control is robust against unknown damping in the case of fully-actuated systems.</data>

      <data key="title">on differentially dissipative dynamical systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Dissipativity is an essential concept of systems theory. The paper provides an extension of dissipativity, named differential dissipativity, by lifting storage functions and supply rates to the tangent bundle. Differential dissipativity is connected to incremental stability in the same way as dissipativity is connected to stability. It leads to a natural formulation of differential passivity when restricting to quadratic supply rates. The paper also shows that the interconnection of differentially passive systems is differentially passive, and provides preliminary examples of differentially passive electrical systems.</data>

      <data key="title">a contractive approach to separable lyapunov functions for monotone systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Monotone systems preserve a partial ordering of states along system trajectories and are often amenable to separable Lyapunov functions that are either the sum or the maximum of a collection of functions of a scalar argument. In this paper, we consider constructing separable Lyapunov functions for monotone systems that are also contractive, that is, the distance between any pair of trajectories exponentially decreases. The distance is defined in terms of a possibly state-dependent norm. When this norm is a weighted one-norm, we obtain conditions which lead to sum-separable Lyapunov functions, and when this norm is a weighted infinity-norm, symmetric conditions lead to max-separable Lyapunov functions. In addition, we consider two classes of Lyapunov functions: the first class is separable along the system's state, and the second class is separable along components of the system's vector field. The latter case is advantageous for many practically motivated systems for which it is difficult to measure the system's state but easier to measure the system's velocity or rate of change. In addition, we present an algorithm based on sum-of-squares programming to compute such separable Lyapunov functions. We provide several examples to demonstrate our results.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The paper introduces and studies differentially positive systems, that is, systems whose linearization along an arbitrary trajectory is positive. A generalization of Perron Frobenius theory is developed in this differential framework to show that the property induces a (conal) order that strongly constrains the asymptotic behavior of solutions. The results illustrate that behaviors constrained by local order properties extend beyond the well-studied class of linear positive systems and monotone systems, which both require a constant cone field and a linear state space.</data>

      <data key="title">control contraction metrics convex and intrinsic criteria for nonlinear feedback design</data>
      <data key="abstract">We introduce the concept of a control contraction metric, extending contraction analysis to constructive nonlinear control design. We derive sufficient conditions for exponential stabilizability of all trajectories of a nonlinear control system. The conditions have a simple geometrical interpretation, can be written as a convex feasibility problem, and are invariant under coordinate changes. We show that these conditions are necessary and sufficient for feedback linearizable systems, and also derive novel convex criteria for exponential stabilization of a nonlinear submanifold of state space. We illustrate the benefits of convexity by constructing a controller for an unstable polynomial system that combines local optimality and global stability, using a metric found via sum-of-squares programming.</data>

      <data key="title">contracting nonlinear observers convex optimization and learning from data</data>
      <data key="abstract">A new approach to design of nonlinear observers (state estimators) is proposed. The main idea is to (i) construct a convex set of dynamical systems which are contracting observers for a particular system, and (ii) optimize over this set for one which minimizes a bound on state-estimation error on a simulated noisy data set. We construct convex sets of continuous-time and discrete-time observers, as well as contracting sampled-data observers for continuous-time systems. Convex bounds for learning are constructed using Lagrangian relaxation. The utility of the proposed methods are verified using numerical simulation.</data>

      <data key="title">privacy preserving nonlinear observer design using contraction analysis</data>
      <data key="abstract">Real-time information processing applications such as those enabling a more intelligent infrastructure are increasingly focused on analyzing privacy-sensitive data obtained from individuals. To produce accurate statistics about the habits of a population of users of a system, this data might need to be processed through model-based estimators. Moreover, models of population dynamics, originating for example from epidemiology or the social sciences, are often necessarily nonlinear. Motivated by these trends, this paper presents an approach to design nonlinear privacy-preserving model-based observers, relying on additive input or output noise to give differential privacy guarantees to the individuals providing the input data. For the case of output perturbation, contraction analysis allows us to design convergent observers as well as set the level of privacy-preserving noise appropriately. Two examples illustrate the approach: estimating the edge formation probabilities in a dynamic social network, and syndromic surveillance relying on an epidemiological model.</data>

      <data key="title">on existence of separable contraction metrics for monotone nonlinear systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Finding separable certificates of stability is important for tractability of analysis methods for large-scale networked systems. In this paper we consider the question of when a nonlinear system which is contracting, i.e. all solutions are exponentially stable, can have that property verified by a separable metric. Making use of recent results in the theory of positive linear systems and separable Lyapunov functions, we prove several new results showing when this is possible, and discuss the application of to nonlinear distributed control design via convex optimization.</data>

      <data key="title">a dissipativity theorem for p dominant systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">We revisit the classical dissipativity theorem of linear-quadratic theory in a generalized framework where the quadratic storage is negative definite in a p-dimensional subspace and positive definite in a complementary subspace. The classical theory assumes p = 0 and provides an inter- connection theory for stability analysis, i.e. convergence to a zero dimensional attractor. The generalized theory is shown to provide an interconnection theory for p-dominance analysis, i.e. convergence to a p-dimensional dominant subspace. In turn, this property is the differential characterization of a generalized contraction property for nonlinear systems. The proposed generalization opens a novel avenue for the analysis of interconnected systems with low-dimensional attractors.</data>

      <data key="title">conditions on shifted passivity of port hamiltonian systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we examine the shifted passivity property of port-Hamiltonian systems. Shifted passivity accounts for the fact that in many applications the desired steady-state values of the input and output variables are nonzero, and thus one is interested in passivity with respect to the shifted signals. We consider port-Hamiltonian systems with strictly convex Hamiltonian, and derive conditions under which shifted passivity is guaranteed. In case the Hamiltonian is quadratic and state dependency appears in an affine manner in the dissipation and interconnection matrices, our conditions reduce to negative semidefiniteness of an appropriately constructed constant matrix. Moreover, we elaborate on how these conditions can be extended to the case when the shifted passivity property can be enforced via output feedback, thus paving the path for controller design. Stability of forced equilibria of the system is analyzed invoking the proposed passivity conditions. The utility and relevance of the results are illustrated with their application to a 6th order synchronous generator model as well as a controlled rigid body system.</data>

      <data key="title">contracting implicit recurrent neural networks stable models with improved trainability</data>
      <data key="abstract">Stability of recurrent models is closely linked with trainability, generalizability and in some applications, safety. Methods that train stable recurrent neural networks, however, do so at a significant cost to expressibility. We propose an implicit model structure that allows for a convex parametrization of stable models using contraction analysis of non-linear systems. Using these stability conditions we propose a new approach to model initialization and then provide a number of empirical results comparing the performance of our proposed model set to previous stable RNNs and vanilla RNNs. By carefully controlling stability in the model, we observe a significant increase in the speed of training and model performance.</data>
