      <data key="title">characterizing continuous time random walks on time varying graphs</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper we study the behavior of a continuous time random walk (CTRW) on a stationary and ergodic time varying dynamic graph. We establish conditions under which the CTRW is a stationary and ergodic process. In general, the stationary distribution of the walker depends on the walker rate and is difficult to characterize. However, we characterize the stationary distribution in the following cases: i) the walker rate is significantly larger or smaller than the rate in which the graph changes (time-scale separation), ii) the walker rate is proportional to the degree of the node that it resides on (coupled dynamics), and iii) the degrees of node belonging to the same connected component are identical (structural constraints). We provide examples that illustrate our theoretical findings.</data>

      <data key="title">discovering patterns of interest in ip traffic using cliques in bipartite link streams</data>
      <data key="abstract">Studying IP traffic is crucial for many applications. We focus here on the detection of (structurally and temporally) dense sequences of interactions, that may indicate botnets or coordinated network scans. More precisely, we model a MAWI capture of IP traffic as a link streams, i.e. a sequence of interactions $(t_1 , t_2 , u, v)$ meaning that devices $u$ and $v$ exchanged packets from time $t_1$ to time $t_2$ . This traffic is captured on a single router and so has a bipartite structure: links occur only between nodes in two disjoint sets. We design a method for finding interesting bipartite cliques in such link streams, i.e. two sets of nodes and a time interval such that all nodes in the first set are linked to all nodes in the second set throughout the time interval. We then explore the bipartite cliques present in the considered trace. Comparison with the MAWILab classification of anomalous IP addresses shows that the found cliques succeed in detecting anomalous network activity.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This thesis summarises my scientific contributions in the domain of network science, human dynamics and computational social science. These contributions are associated to computer science, physics, statistics, and applied mathematics. The goal of this thesis is twofold, on one hand to write a concise summary of my most interesting scientific contributions, and on the other hand to provide an up-to-date view and perspective about my field. I start my dissertation with an introduction to position the reader on the landscape of my field and to put in perspective my contributions. In the second chapter I concentrate on my works on bursty human dynamics, addressing heterogeneous temporal characters of human actions and interactions. Next, I discuss my contributions to the field of temporal networks and give a synthesises of my works on various methods of the representation, characterisation, and modelling of time-varying structures. Finally, I discuss my works on the data-driven observations and modelling of collective social phenomena. There, I summarise studies on the static observations of emergent patterns of socioeconomic inequalities and their correlations with social-communication networks, and with linguistic patterns. I also discuss dynamic observations and modelling of social contagion processes.</data>

      <data key="title">algorithmic networks central time to trigger expected emergent open endedness</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   This article investigates emergence of algorithmic complexity in computable systems that can share information on a network. To this end, we use a theoretical approach from information theory, computability theory, and complex networks theory. One key studied question is how much emergent complexity arises when a population of computable systems is networked compared with when this population is isolated. First, we define a general model for networked theoretical machines, which we call algorithmic networks. Then, we narrow our scope to investigate algorithmic networks that increase the average fitnesses of nodes in a scenario in which each node imitates the fittest neighbor and the randomly generated population is networked by a time-varying graph. We show that there are graph-topological conditions that make these algorithmic networks have the property of expected emergent open-endedness for large enough populations. In other words, the expected emergent algorithmic complexity of a node tends to infinity as the population size tends to infinity. Given a dynamic network, we show that these conditions imply the existence of a central time to trigger expected emergent open-endedness. Moreover, we show that networks with small diameter compared to the network size meet these conditions.</data>

      <data key="title">kernel based reconstruction of space time functions on dynamic graphs</data>
      <data key="abstract">Graph-based methods pervade the inference toolkits of numerous disciplines including sociology, biology, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, and engineering. A challenging problem encountered in this context pertains to determining the attributes of a set of vertices given those of another subset at possibly different time instants. Leveraging spatiotemporal dynamics can drastically reduce the number of observed vertices, and hence the cost of sampling. Alleviating the limited flexibility of existing approaches, the present paper broadens the existing kernel-based graph function reconstruction framework to accommodate time-evolving functions over possibly time-evolving topologies. This approach inherits the versatility and generality of kernel-based methods, for which no knowledge on distributions or second-order statistics is required. Systematic guidelines are provided to construct two families of space-time kernels with complementary strengths. The first facilitates judicious control of regularization on a space-time frequency plane, whereas the second can afford time-varying topologies. Batch and online estimators are also put forth, and a novel kernel Kalman filter is developed to obtain these estimates at affordable computational cost. Numerical tests with real data sets corroborate the merits of the proposed methods relative to competing alternatives.</data>

      <data key="title">stream graphs and link streams for the modeling of interactions over time</data>
      <data key="abstract">Graph theory provides a language for studying the structure of relations, and it is often used to study interactions over time too. However, it poorly captures the both temporal and structural nature of interactions, that calls for a dedicated formalism. In this paper, we generalize graph concepts in order to cope with both aspects in a consistent way. We start with elementary concepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced concepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected components. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time, similar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations. This formalism is self-consistent: usual relations between different concepts are preserved. It is also consistent with graph theory: graph concepts are special cases of the ones we introduce. This makes it easy to generalize higher-level objects such as quotient graphs, line graphs, k-cores, and centralities. This paper also considers discrete versus continuous time assumptions, instantaneous links, and extensions to more complex cases.</data>

      <data key="title">social events in a time varying mobile phone graph</data>
      <data key="abstract">The large-scale study of human mobility has been significantly enhanced over the last decade by the massive use of mobile phones in urban populations. Studying the activity of mobile phones allows us, not only to infer social networks between individuals, but also to observe the movements of these individuals in space and time. In this work, we investigate how these two related sources of information can be integrated within the context of detecting and analyzing large social events. We show that large social events can be characterized not only by an anomalous increase in activity of the antennas in the neighborhood of the event, but also by an increase in social relationships of the attendants present in the event. Moreover, having detected a large social event via increased antenna activity, we can use the network connections to infer whether an unobserved user was present at the event. More precisely, we address the following three challenges: (i) automatically detecting large social events via increased antenna activity; (ii) characterizing the social cohesion of the detected event; and (iii) analyzing the feasibility of inferring whether unobserved users were in the event.</data>

      <data key="title">the temporal event graph</data>
      <data key="abstract">Temporal networks are increasingly being used to model the interactions of complex systems. Most studies require the temporal aggregation of edges (or events) into discrete time steps to perform analysis. In this article we describe a static, lossless, and unique representation of a temporal network, the temporal event graph (TEG). The TEG describes the temporal network in terms of both the inter-event time and two-event temporal motif distributions. By considering these distributions in unison we provide a new method to characterise the behaviour of individuals and collectives in temporal networks as well as providing a natural decomposition of the network. We illustrate the utility of the TEG by providing examples on both synthetic and real temporal networks.</data>

      <data key="title">a tutorial on clique problems in communications and signal processing</data>
      <data key="abstract">Since its first use by Euler on the seven bridges of K{o}nigsberg problem, graph theory has shown excellent abilities in solving and unveiling the properties of multiple discrete optimization problems notably in communications and signal processing. The study of the structure of integer programs reveals equivalence with graph theory problems, which makes a large body of the literature readily available for solving and characterizing the complexity of these problems. This tutorial presents a framework for utilizing a particular graph theory problem, known as the clique problem, for solving communications and signal processing problems. In particular, the paper aims to illustrate the structural properties of problems that can be formulated as clique problems through multiple examples in communications and signal processing. To that end, the first part of the tutorial formulates and suggests various optimal and heuristic solutions for the clique problem and its variants. The tutorial, further, illustrates the use of the clique formulation and its variants through numerous contemporary examples in communications and signal processing, mainly in maximum access problem for non-orthogonal multiple access networks, throughput maximization using index coding and instantly decodable network coding, collision-free radio frequency identification networks, and resource allocation in cloud-radio access networks. The tutorial finally sheds light on the recent advances of such applications and discusses future research directions on the topics.</data>

      <data key="title">time centrality in dynamic complex networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">There is an ever-increasing interest in investigating dynamics in time-varying graphs (TVGs). Nevertheless, so far, the notion of centrality in TVG scenarios usually refers to metrics that assess the relative importance of nodes along the temporal evolution of the dynamic complex network. For some TVG scenarios, however, more important than identifying the central nodes under a given node centrality definition is identifying the key time instants for taking certain actions. In this paper, we thus introduce and investigate the notion of time centrality in TVGs. Analogously to node centrality, time centrality evaluates the relative importance of time instants in dynamic complex networks. In this context, we present two time centrality metrics related to diffusion processes. We evaluate the two defined metrics using both a real-world dataset representing an in-person contact dynamic network and a synthetically generated randomized TVG. We validate the concept of time centrality showing that diffusion starting at the best ranked time instants (i.e., the most central ones), according to our metrics, can perform a faster and more efficient diffusion process.</data>

      <data key="title">time varying graphs and dynamic networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems -- delay-tolerant networks, opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks -- obtaining closely related insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on whether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction of randomness in TVGs.</data>

      <data key="title">analysing collective behaviour in temporal networks using event graphs and temporal motifs</data>
      <data key="abstract">Historically studies of behaviour on networks have focused on the behaviour of individuals (node-based) or on the aggregate behaviour of the entire network. We propose a new method to decompose a temporal network into macroscale components and to analyse the behaviour of these components, or collectives of nodes, across time. This method utilises all available information in the temporal network (i.e. no temporal aggregation), combining both topological and temporal structure using temporal motifs and inter-event times. This allows us create an embedding of a temporal network in order to describe behaviour over time and at different timescales. We illustrate this method using an example of digital communication data collected from an online social network.</data>

      <data key="title">multiaspect graphs algebraic representation and algorithms</data>
      <data key="abstract">We present the algebraic representation and basic algorithms for MultiAspect Graphs (MAGs). A MAG is a structure capable of representing multilayer and time-varying networks, as well as higher-order networks, while also having the property of being isomorphic to a directed graph. In particular, we show that, as a consequence of the properties associated with the MAG structure, a MAG can be represented in matrix form. Moreover, we also show that any possible MAG function (algorithm) can be obtained from this matrix-based representation. This is an important theoretical result since it paves the way for adapting well-known graph algorithms for application in MAGs. We present a set of basic MAG algorithms, constructed from well-known graph algorithms, such as degree computing, Breadth First Search (BFS), and Depth First Search (DFS). These algorithms adapted to the MAG context can be used as primitives for building other more sophisticated MAG algorithms. Therefore, such examples can be seen as guidelines on how to properly derive MAG algorithms from basic algorithms on directed graph. We also make available Python implementations of all the algorithms presented in this paper.</data>

      <data key="abstract">This paper aims at precisely detecting and identifying anomalous events in IP traffic. To this end, we adopt the link stream formalism which properly captures temporal and structural features of the data. Within this framework, we focus on finding anomalous behaviours with respect to the degree of IP addresses over time. Due to diversity in IP profiles, this feature is typically distributed heterogeneously, preventing us to directly find anomalies. To deal with this challenge, we design a method to detect outliers as well as precisely identify their cause in a sequence of similar heterogeneous distributions. We apply it to several MAWI captures of IP traffic and we show that it succeeds in detecting relevant patterns in terms of anomalous network activity.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Graph drawing and visualisation techniques are important tools for the exploratory analysis of complex systems. While these methods are regularly applied to visualise data on complex networks, we increasingly have access to time series data that can be modelled as temporal networks or dynamic graphs. In such dynamic graphs, the temporal ordering of time-stamped edges determines the causal topology of a system, i.e. which nodes can directly and indirectly influence each other via a so-called causal path. While this causal topology is crucial to understand dynamical processes, the role of nodes, or cluster structures, we lack graph drawing techniques that incorporate this information into static visualisations. Addressing this gap, we present a novel dynamic graph drawing algorithm that utilises higher-order graphical models of causal paths in time series data to compute time-aware static graph visualisations. These visualisations combine the simplicity of static graphs with a time-aware layout algorithm that highlights patterns in the causal topology that result from the temporal dynamics of edges.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Since all the existing real world networks are evolving, the study of traffic dynamics is a challenging task. Avoidance of traffic congestion, system utility maximization and enhancement of network capacity are prominent issues. Network capacity may be improved either by optimizing network topology or enhancing in routing approach. In this context, we propose and design a model of the time-varying data communication networks (TVCN) based on the dynamics of inflowing links. Traffic congestion can be avoided by using a suitable centrality measure, especially betweenness and Eigen vector centralities. If the nodes coming in user’s route are most betweenness central, then that route will be highly congested. Eigen vector centrality is used to find the influence of a node on others. If a node is most influential, then it will be highly congested and considered as least reputed. For that reason, routes are chosen such that the sum of the centralities of the nodes coming in user’s route should be minimum. Furthe...</data>

      <data key="title">a unifying model for representing time varying graphs</data>
      <data key="abstract">Graph-based models form a fundamental aspect of data representation in Data Sciences and play a key role in modeling complex networked systems. In particular, recently there is an ever-increasing interest in modeling dynamic complex networks, i.e. networks in which the topological structure (nodes and edges) may vary over time. In this context, we propose a novel model for representing finite discrete Time-Varying Graphs (TVGs), which are typically used to model dynamic complex networked systems. We analyze the data structures built from our proposed model and demonstrate that, for most practical cases, the asymptotic memory complexity of our model is in the order of the cardinality of the set of edges. Further, we show that our proposal is an unifying model that can represent several previous (classes of) models for dynamic networks found in the recent literature, which in general are unable to represent each other. In contrast to previous models, our proposal is also able to intrinsically model cyclic (i.e. periodic) behavior in dynamic networks. These representation capabilities attest the expressive power of our proposed unifying model for TVGs. We thus believe our unifying model for TVGs is a step forward in the theoretical foundations for data analysis of complex networked systems.</data>

      <data key="title">on multiaspect graphs</data>
      <data key="abstract">Different graph generalizations have been recently used in an ad-hoc manner to represent multilayer networks, i.e. systems formed by distinct layers where each layer can be seen as a network. Similar constructions have also been used to represent time-varying networks. We introduce the concept of MultiAspect Graph (MAG) as a graph generalization that we prove to be isomorphic to a directed graph, and also capable of representing all previous generalizations. In our proposal, the set of vertices, layers, time instants, or any other independent features are considered as an aspect of the MAG. For instance, a MAG is able to represent multilayer or time-varying networks, while both concepts can also be combined to represent a multilayer time-varying network and even other higher-order networks. Since the MAG structure admits an arbitrary (finite) number of aspects, it hence introduces a powerful modeling abstraction for networked complex systems. This paper formalizes the concept of MAG and derives theoretical results useful in the analysis of complex networked systems modeled using the proposed MAG abstraction. We also present an overview of the MAG applicability.</data>

      <data key="title">an introduction to temporal graphs an algorithmic perspective</data>
      <data key="abstract">A \emph{temporal graph} is, informally speaking, a graph that changes with time. When time is discrete and only the relationships between the participating entities may change and not the entities themselves, a temporal graph may be viewed as a sequence $G_1,G_2\ldots,G_l$ of static graphs over the same (static) set of nodes $V$. Though static graphs have been extensively studied, for their temporal generalization we are still far from having a concrete set of structural and algorithmic principles. Recent research shows that many graph properties and problems become radically different and usually substantially more difficult when an extra time dimension in added to them. Moreover, there is already a rich and rapidly growing set of modern systems and applications that can be naturally modeled and studied via temporal graphs. This, further motivates the need for the development of a temporal extension of graph theory. We survey here recent results on temporal graphs and temporal graph problems that have appeared in the Computer Science community.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Recent advances in data collection and storage have allowed both researchers and industry alike to collect data in real time. Much of this data comes in the form of 'events', or timestamped interactions, such as email and social media posts, website clickstreams, or protein-protein interactions. This of type data poses new challenges for modelling, especially if we wish to preserve all temporal features and structure. We propose a generalised framework to explore temporal networks using second-order time-unfolded models, called event graphs. Through examples we demonstrate how event graphs can be used to understand the higher-order topological-temporal structure of temporal networks and capture properties of the network that are unobserved when considering either a static (or time-aggregated) model. Furthermore, we show that by modelling a temporal network as an event graph our analysis extends easily to consider non-dyadic interactions, known as hyper-events.</data>
