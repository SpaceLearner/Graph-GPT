      <data key="title">quality of information in mobile crowdsensing survey and research challenges</data>
      <data key="abstract">Smartphones have become the most pervasive devices in people's lives, and are clearly transforming the way we live and perceive technology. Today's smartphones benefit from almost ubiquitous Internet connectivity and come equipped with a plethora of inexpensive yet powerful embedded sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, and camera. This unique combination has enabled revolutionary applications based on the mobile crowdsensing paradigm, such as real-time road traffic monitoring, air and noise pollution, crime control, and wildlife monitoring, just to name a few. Differently from prior sensing paradigms, humans are now the primary actors of the sensing process, since they become fundamental in retrieving reliable and up-to-date information about the event being monitored. As humans may behave unreliably or maliciously, assessing and guaranteeing Quality of Information (QoI) becomes more important than ever. In this paper, we provide a new framework for defining and enforcing the QoI in mobile crowdsensing, and analyze in depth the current state-of-the-art on the topic. We also outline novel research challenges, along with possible directions of future work.</data>

      <data key="title">securing the internet of things in the age of machine learning and software defined networking</data>
      <data key="abstract">The Internet of Things (IoT) realizes a vision where billions of interconnected devices are deployed just about everywhere, from inside our bodies to the most remote areas of the globe. As the IoT will soon pervade every aspect of our lives and will be accessible from anywhere, addressing critical IoT security threats is now more important than ever. Traditional approaches where security is applied as an afterthought and as a “patch” against known attacks are insufficient. Indeed, next-generation IoT challenges will require a new secure-by-design vision, where threats are addressed proactively and IoT devices learn to dynamically adapt to different threats. To this end, machine learning (ML) and software-defined networking (SDN) will be key to provide both reconfigurability and intelligence to the IoT devices. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy and survey the state of the art in IoT security research, and offer a roadmap of concrete research challenges related to the application of ML and SDN to address existing and next-generation IoT security threats.</data>

      <data key="title">taskme multi task allocation in mobile crowd sensing</data>
      <data key="abstract">Task allocation or participant selection is a key issue in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). While previous participant selection approaches mainly focus on selecting a proper subset of users for a single MCS task, multi-task-oriented participant selection is essential and useful for the efficiency of large-scale MCS platforms. This paper proposes TaskMe, a participant selection framework for multi-task MCS environments. In particular, two typical multi-task allocation situations with bi-objective optimization goals are studied: (1) For FPMT (few participants, more tasks), each participant is required to complete multiple tasks and the optimization goal is to maximize the total number of accomplished tasks while minimizing the total movement distance. (2) For MPFT (more participants, few tasks), each participant is selected to perform one task based on pre-registered working areas in view of privacy, and the optimization objective is to minimize total incentive payments while minimizing the total traveling distance. Two optimal algorithms based on the Minimum Cost Maximum Flow theory are proposed for FPMT, and two algorithms based on the multi-objective optimization theory are proposed for MPFT. Experiments verify that the proposed algorithms outperform baselines based on a large-scale real-word dataset under different experiment settings (the number of tasks, various task distributions, etc.).</data>

      <data key="title">incentme effective mechanism design to stimulate crowdsensing participants with uncertain mobility</data>
      <data key="abstract">Mobile crowdsensing harnesses the sensing power of modern smartphones to collect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possible. In a mobile crowdsensing system, it is paramount to incentivize smartphone users to provide sensing services in a timely and reliable manner. Given sensed information is often valid for a limited period of time, the capability of smartphone users to execute sensing tasks largely depends on their mobility, which is often uncertain. For this reason, in this paper we propose IncentMe, a framework that solves this fundamental problem by leveraging game-theoretical reverse auction mechanism design. After demonstrating that the proposed problem is NP-hard, we derive two mechanisms that are parallelizable and achieve higher approximation ratio than existing work. IncentMe has been extensively evaluated on a road traffic monitoring application implemented using mobility traces of taxi cabs in San Francisco, Rome, and Beijing. Results demonstrate that the mechanisms in IncentMe outperform prior work by improving the efficiency in recruiting participants by 30%.</data>

      <data key="title">fridges on the highway road traffic poisoning of navigation apps</data>
      <data key="abstract">Assisted navigation software apps have a relevant impact on our daily life. Such apps infer the current state of roads mainly relying on the information provided by the devices they are running over. However, technological progress in two independent fields, i.e., mobile phone virtualization and Software Defined Radios, has enabled brand new types of attacks. It is nowadays possible to create fake queues of vehicles wherever in the world, as well as to make a congested street look like the best path to speed your travel. We refer to the aforementioned attacks as road traffic poisoning. These attacks open up several dreadful scenarios, where users can be maliciously re-routed by creating congestion in target positions, or to have users choose a given path since it is allegedly free from traffic, in both cases possibly affecting people's safety. In this paper, we analyze several scenarios, and discuss different adversary models, tools, and related attacks. We also propose a few novel countermeasures that could be adopted to mitigate the above threats, their limitations, and the open issues ahead.</data>

      <data key="title">a trust based recruitment framework for multi hop social participatory sensing</data>
      <data key="abstract">The idea of social participatory sensing provides a substrate to benefit from friendship relations in recruiting a critical mass of participants willing to attend in a sensing campaign. However, the selection of suitable participants who are trustable and provide high quality contributions is challenging. In this paper, we propose a recruitment framework for social participatory sensing. Our framework leverages multi-hop friendship relations to identify and select suitable and trustworthy participants among friends or friends of friends, and finds the most trustable paths to them. The framework also includes a suggestion component which provides a cluster of suggested friends along with the path to them, which can be further used for recruitment or friendship establishment. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed recruitment framework in terms of selecting a large number of well-suited participants and providing contributions with high overall trust, in comparison with one-hop recruitment architecture.</data>

      <data key="abstract">One of the key challenges to the IoT's success is how to secure and anonymize billions of IoT transactions and devices per day, an issue that still lingers despite significant research efforts over the last few years. On the other hand, technologies based on blockchain algorithms are disrupting today's cryptocurrency markets and showing tremendous potential, since they provide a distributed transaction ledger that cannot be tampered with or controlled by a single entity. Although the blockchain may present itself as a cure-all for the IoT's security and privacy challenges, significant research efforts still need to be put forth to adapt the computation-intensive blockchain algorithms to the stringent energy and processing constraints of today's IoT devices. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing literature on the topic of blockchain for IoT, and present a roadmap of research challenges that will need to be addressed to enable the usage of blockchain technologies in the IoT.</data>

      <data key="title">first a framework for optimizing information quality in mobile crowdsensing systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Mobile crowdsensing allows data collection at a scale and pace that was once impossible. One of the biggest challenges in mobile crowdsensing is that participants may exhibit malicious or unreliable behavior. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design algorithms to accurately classify between reliable and unreliable sensing reports. To this end, we propose a novel Framework for optimizing Information Reliability in Smartphone-based participaTory sensing (FIRST), that leverages mobile trusted participants (MTPs) to securely assess the reliability of sensing reports. FIRST models and solves the challenging problem of determining before deployment the minimum number of MTPs to be used in order to achieve desired classification accuracy. We extensively evaluate FIRST through an implementation in iOS and Android of a room occupancy monitoring system, and through simulations with real-world mobility traces. Experimental results demonstrate that FIRST reduces significantly the impact of three security attacks (i.e., corruption, on/off, and collusion), by achieving a classification accuracy of almost 80% in the considered scenarios. Finally, we discuss our ongoing research efforts to test the performance of FIRST as part of the National Map Corps project.</data>

      <data key="title">sacrm social aware crowdsourcing with reputation management in mobile sensing</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   Mobile sensing has become a promising paradigm for mobile users to obtain information by task crowdsourcing. However, due to the social preferences of mobile users, the quality of sensing reports may be impacted by the underlying social attributes and selfishness of individuals. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the social impacts and trustworthiness of mobile users when selecting task participants in mobile sensing. In this paper, we propose a  S ocial  A ware  C rowdsourcing with  R eputation  M anagement (SACRM) scheme to select the well-suited participants and allocate the task rewards in mobile sensing. Specifically, we consider the social attributes, task delay and reputation in crowdsourcing and propose a participant selection scheme to choose the well-suited participants for the sensing task under a fixed task budget. A report assessment and rewarding scheme is also introduced to measure the quality of the sensing reports and allocate the task rewards based the assessed report quality. In addition, we develop a reputation management scheme to evaluate the trustworthiness and cost performance ratio of mobile users for participant selection. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that SACRM can efficiently improve the crowdsourcing utility and effectively stimulate the participants to improve the quality of their sensing reports.</data>

      <data key="title">hytasker hybrid task allocation in mobile crowd sensing</data>
      <data key="abstract">Task allocation is a major challenge in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). While previous task allocation approaches follow either the opportunistic or participatory mode, this paper proposes to integrate these two complementary modes in a two-phased hybrid framework called HyTasker. In the offline phase, a group of workers (called opportunistic workers) are selected, and they complete MCS tasks during their daily routines (i.e., opportunistic mode). In the online phase, we assign another set of workers (called participatory workers) and require them to move specifically to perform tasks that are not completed by the opportunistic workers (i.e., participatory mode). Instead of considering these two phases separately, HyTasker jointly optimizes them with a total incentive budget constraint. In particular, when selecting opportunistic workers in the offline phase of HyTasker, we propose a novel algorithm that simultaneously considers the predicted task assignment for the participatory workers, in which the density and mobility of participatory workers are taken into account. Experiments on a real-world mobility dataset demonstrate that HyTasker outperforms other methods with more completed tasks under the same budget constraint.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Thanks to information explosion, data for the objects of interest can be collected from increasingly more sources. However, for the same object, there usually exist conflicts among the collected multi-source information. To tackle this challenge, truth discovery, which integrates multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source, has emerged as a hot topic. Several truth discovery methods have been proposed for various scenarios, and they have been successfully applied in diverse application domains. In this survey, we focus on providing a comprehensive overview of truth discovery methods, and summarizing them from different aspects. We also discuss some future directions of truth discovery research. We hope that this survey will promote a better understanding of the current progress on truth discovery, and offer some guidelines on how to apply these approaches in application domains.</data>

      <data key="title">trust evaluation mechanism for user recruitment in mobile crowd sensing in the internet of things</data>
      <data key="abstract">Mobile Crowd-Sensing (MCS) has appeared as a prospective solution for large-scale data collection, leveraging built-in sensors and social applications in mobile devices that enables a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) services. However, the human involvement in MCS results in a high possibility for unintentionally contributing corrupted and falsified data or intentionally spreading disinformation for malevolent purposes, consequently undermining IoT services. Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays a crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing better quality of services while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this article, a novel trust model called Experience-Reputation (E-R) is proposed for evaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in a MCS platform. To enable the E-R model, virtual interactions among the users are manipulated by considering an assessment of the quality of contributed data from such users. Based on these interactions, two indicators of trust called Experience and Reputation are calculated accordingly. By incorporating the Experience and Reputation trust indicators (TIs), trust relationships between the users are established, evaluated and maintained. Based on these trust relationships, a novel trust-based recruitment scheme is carried out for selecting the most trustworthy MCS users to contribute to data sensing tasks. In order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed trust-based mechanism as well as the E-R trust model, we deploy several recruitment schemes in a MCS testbed which consists of both normal and malicious users. The results highlight the strength of the trust-based scheme as it delivers better quality for MCS services while being able to detect malicious users.</data>

      <data key="title">centurion incentivizing multi requester mobile crowd sensing</data>
      <data key="abstract">The recent proliferation of increasingly capable mobile devices has given rise to mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems that outsource the collection of sensory data to a crowd of participating workers that carry various mobile devices. Aware of the paramount importance of effectively incentivizing participation in such systems, the research community has proposed a wide variety of incentive mechanisms. However, different from most of these existing mechanisms which assume the existence of only one data requester, we consider MCS systems with multiple data requesters, which are actually more common in practice. Specifically, our incentive mechanism is based on double auction, and is able to stimulate the participation of both data requesters and workers. In real practice, the incentive mechanism is typically not an isolated module, but interacts with the data aggregation mechanism that aggregates workers' data. For this reason, we propose CENTURION, a novel integrated framework for multi-requester MCS systems, consisting of the aforementioned incentive and data aggregation mechanism. CENTURION's incentive mechanism satisfies truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency, as well as guaranteeing non-negative social welfare, and its data aggregation mechanism generates highly accurate aggregated results. The desirable properties of CENTURION are validated through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.</data>

      <data key="title">ear phone a context aware noise mapping using smart phones</data>
      <data key="abstract">A noise map facilitates the monitoring of environmental noise pollution in urban areas. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in urban areas are expensive and rarely updated, as they rely on population and traffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing can be leveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to- date noise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system called Ear-Phone. Ear-Phone investigates the use of different interpolation and regularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the noise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data collection. Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One mobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise pollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones as sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary depending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the user is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her palm). To address this problem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to accurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery, Ear-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-phone also implements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be carried out without any technical skills whatsoever required on the user's part. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone is a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system resource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction accuracy of the noise map.</data>

      <data key="title">mining users significant driving routes with low power sensors</data>
      <data key="abstract">While there is significant work on sensing and recognition of significant places for users, little attention has been given to users' significant routes. Recognizing these routine journeys, opens doors to the development of novel applications, like personalized travel alerts, and enhancement of user's travel experience. However, the high energy consumption of traditional location sensing technologies, such as GPS or WiFi based localization, is a barrier to passive and ubiquitous route sensing through smartphones. #R##N#In this paper, we present a passive route sensing framework that continuously monitors a vehicle user solely through a phone's gyroscope and accelerometer. This approach can differentiate and recognize various routes taken by the user by time warping angular speeds experienced by the phone while in transit and is independent of phone orientation and location within the vehicle, small detours and traffic conditions. We compare the route learning and recognition capabilities of this approach with GPS trajectory analysis and show that it achieves similar performance. Moreover, with an embedded co-processor, common to most new generation phones, it achieves energy savings of an order of magnitude over the GPS sensor.</data>

      <data key="title">a bayesian approach to discovering truth from conflicting sources for data integration</data>
      <data key="abstract">In practical data integration systems, it is common for the data sources being integrated to provide conflicting information about the same entity. Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. We term this challenge the truth finding problem. We observe that some sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer true records and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two different aspects of source quality. In so doing, ours is also the first approach designed to merge multi-valued attribute types. Our method is scalable, due to an efficient sampling-based inference algorithm that needs very few iterations in practice and enjoys linear time complexity, with an even faster incremental variant. Experiments on two real world datasets show that our new method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches to the truth finding problem.</data>

      <data key="title">a novel methodology for designing policies in mobile crowdsensing systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Mobile crowdsensing is a people-centric sensing system based on users' contributions and incentive mechanisms aim at stimulating them. In our work, we have rethought the design of incentive mechanisms through a game-theoretic methodology. Thus, we have introduced a multi-layer social sensing framework, where humans as social sensors interact on multiple social layers and various services. We have proposed to weigh these dynamic interactions by including the concept of homophily, that is a human-related factor related to the similarity and frequency of interactions on the multiplex network. We have modeled the evolutionary dynamics of sensing behaviours by defining a mathematical framework based on multiplex EGT, quantifying the impact of homophily, network heterogeneity and various social dilemmas. We have detected the configurations of social dilemmas and network structures that lead to the emergence and sustainability of human cooperation. Moreover, we have defined and evaluated local and global Nash equilibrium points in our structured population by including the concepts of homophily and heterogeneity. We have analytically defined and measured novel statistical measures of QoI and user reputation scores based on the evolutionary dynamics. Measures are distinct for the different configurations and higher for the most cooperative ones. Through the proposed methodology we have defined the core of a DSS for designing novel incentive mechanisms by operating on the policies in terms of QoI and user reputation scores.</data>
