      <data key="title">steganography a secure way for transmission in wireless sensor networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Addressing the security concerns in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a challenging task, which has attracted the attention of many researchers from the last few decades. Researchers have presented various schemes in WSN, addressing the problems of processing, bandwidth, load balancing, and efficient routing. However, little work has been done on security aspects of WSN. In a typical WSN network, the tiny nodes installed on different locations sense the surrounding environment, send the collected data to their neighbors, which in turn is forwarded to a sink node. The sink node aggregate the data received from different sensors and send it to the base station for further processing and necessary actions. In highly critical sensor networks such as military and law enforcement agencies networks, the transmission of such aggregated data via the public network “Internet” is very sensitive and vulnerable to various attacks and risks. Therefore, this paper provides a solution for addressing these security issues based on steganography, where the aggregated data can be embedded as a secret message inside an innocentlooking cover image. The stego image containing the embedded data can be then sent to fusion center using Internet. At the fusion center, the hidden data is extracted from the image, the required processing is performed and decision is taken accordingly. Experimentally, the proposed method is evaluated by objective analysis using peak signal-to noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), normalized cross correlation (NCC), and structural similarity index metric (SSIM), providing promising results in terms of security and image quality, thus validating its superiority.</data>

      <data key="title">security of the internet of things vulnerabilities attacks and countermeasures</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) constitute one of the most promising third-millennium technologies and have a wide range of applications in our surrounding environment. The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e. there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: "Passive Attacks" and "Active Attacks". Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help to pave a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.</data>

      <data key="title">wireless security with beamforming technique</data>
      <data key="abstract">This thesis focuses on the wireless security in the physical layer with beamforming technique. One of the emerging areas is the security enhancement in the physical layer, which exploits the intrinsic properties of the wireless medium. Beamforming, which has been proved to have many advantages, can also be applied to enhance the wireless security. #R##N#One of the most common threats, i.e., passive eavesdropping, is addressed in this thesis. To reduce the risk of leaking information to the eavesdroppers, the physical region where the transmission is exposed to eavesdropping has been studied. In this thesis, the exposure region based beamforming technique is proposed to combat the threat from the randomly located eavesdroppers in a fading channel. In this system model, the large-scale path loss and a general Rician fading channel model are considered. The exposure region is established to describe the secrecy performance of the system, based on which the probability that the secrecy outage event occurs is defined to evaluate the security level of the exposure region. #R##N#The antenna array is one of the most important factors that affect the secrecy performance of the exposure region based beamforming technique. The potential of using different array geometry and array configuration to improve security is explored. In this thesis, two common arrays, i.e., linear and circular arrays, are considered.Analytic expressions for general array geometry and for the linear and circular arrays are derived. Based on the empirical results, numerical optimization algorithms are developed to exploit the array configuration to enhance the system security level. In addition, experiments are carried out to study the performance of the beamformer with linear and circular arrays. Especially, the impact of the mutual coupling on the security performance is investigated.</data>

      <data key="title">a comparison of link layer attacks on wireless sensor networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many potential applications [1, 5] and unique challenges. They usually consist of hundreds or thousands small sensor nodes such as MICA2, which operate autonomously; conditions such as cost, invisible deployment and many application domains, lead to small size and limited resources sensors [2]. WSNs are susceptible to many types of link layer attacks [1] and most of traditional networks security techniques are unusable on WSNs [2]; due to wireless and shared nature of communication channel, untrusted transmissions, deployment in open environments, unattended nature and limited resources [1]. So, security is a vital requirement for these networks; but we have to design a proper security mechanism that attends to WSN's constraints and requirements. In this paper, we focus on security of WSNs, divide it (the WSNs security) into four categories and will consider them, include: an overview of WSNs, security in WSNs, the threat model on WSNs, a wide variety of WSNs' link layer attacks and a comparison of them. This work enables us to identify the purpose and capabilities of the attackers; also, the goal and effects of the link layer attacks on WSNs are introduced. Also, this paper discusses known approaches of security detection and defensive mechanisms against the link layer attacks; this would enable it security managers to manage the link layer attacks of WSNs more effectively.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Wireless Sensor networks (WSN) is an emerging technology and have great potential to be employed in critical situations like battlefields and commercial applications such as building, traffic surveillance, habitat monitoring and smart homes and many more scenarios. One of the major challenges wireless sensor networks face today is security. While the deployment of sensor nodes in an unattended environment makes the networks vulnerable to a variety of potential attacks, the inherent power and memory limitations of sensor nodes makes conventional security solutions unfeasible. The sensing technology combined with processing power and wireless communication makes it profitable for being exploited in great quantity in future. The wireless communication technology also acquires various types of security threats. This paper discusses a wide variety of attacks in WSN and their classification mechanisms and different securities available to handle them including the challenges faced.</data>

      <data key="title">applications of economic and pricing models for wireless network security a survey</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on applications of economic and pricing theory to security issues in wireless networks. Unlike wireline networks, the broadcast nature and the highly dynamic change of network environments pose a number of nontrivial challenges to security design in wireless networks. While the security issues have not been completely solved by traditional or system-based solutions, economic and pricing models recently were employed as one efficient solution to discourage attackers and prevent attacks to be performed. In this paper, we review economic and pricing approaches proposed to address major security issues in wireless networks including eavesdropping attack, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack such as jamming and Distributed DoS (DDoS), and illegitimate behaviors of malicious users. Additionally, we discuss integrating economic and pricing models with cryptography methods to reduce information privacy leakage as well as to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of information in wireless networks. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues and future research directions of applying economic and pricing models to wireless security issues.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Security concern for a Sensor Networks and level of security desired may differ according to application specific needs where the sensor networks are deployed. Till now, most of the security solutions proposed for sensor networks are layer wise i.e a particular solution is applicable to single layer itself. So, to integrate them all is a new research challenge. In this paper we took up the challenge and have proposed an integrated comprehensive security framework that will provide security services for all services of sensor network. We have added one extra component i.e. Intelligent Security Agent (ISA) to assess level of security and cross layer interactions. This framework has many components like Intrusion Detection System, Trust Framework, Key Management scheme and Link layer communication protocol. We have also tested it on three different application scenarios in Castalia and Omnet++ simulator.</data>

      <data key="title">energy harvesting for secure ofdma systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Energy harvesting and physical-layer security in wireless networks are of great significance. In this paper, we study the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, where each user applies power splitting to coordinate the energy harvesting and information decoding processes while secrecy information requirement is guaranteed. The problem is formulated to maximize the aggregate harvested power at the users while satisfying secrecy rate requirements of all users by subcarrier allocation and the optimal power splitting ratio selection. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods.</data>

      <data key="title">information theoretic analysis of an energy harvesting communication system</data>
      <data key="abstract">In energy harvesting communication systems, an exogenous recharge process supplies energy for the data transmission and arriving energy can be buffered in a battery before consumption. Transmission is interrupted if there is not sufficient energy. We address communication with such random energy arrivals in an information-theoretic setting. Based on the classical additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel model, we study the coding problem with random energy arrivals at the transmitter. We show that the capacity of the AWGN channel with stochastic energy arrivals is equal to the capacity with an average power constraint equal to the average recharge rate. We provide two different capacity achieving schemes: save-and-transmit and best-effort-transmit. Next, we consider the case where energy arrivals have time-varying average in a larger time scale. We derive the optimal offline power allocation for maximum average throughput and provide an algorithm that finds the optimal power allocation.</data>

      <data key="title">achievable secrecy rates of an energy harvesting device</data>
      <data key="abstract">The secrecy rate represents the amount of information per unit time that can be securely sent on a communication link. In this work, we investigate the achievable secrecy rates in an energy harvesting communication system composed of a transmitter, a receiver and a malicious eavesdropper. In particular, because of the energy constraints and the channel conditions, it is important to understand when a device should transmit and to optimize how much power should be used to improve security. Both full knowledge and partial knowledge of the channel are considered under a Nakagami fading scenario. We show that high secrecy rates can be obtained only with power  and  coding rate adaptation. Moreover, we highlight the importance of optimally dividing the transmission power in the frequency domain, and note that the optimal scheme provides high gains in secrecy rate over the uniform power splitting case. Analytically, we explain how to find the optimal policy and prove some of its properties. In our numerical evaluation, we discuss how the maximum achievable secrecy rate changes according to the various system parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of a finite battery on the system performance and note that, in order to achieve high secrecy rates, it is not necessary to use very large batteries.</data>

      <data key="title">principles of physical layer security in multiuser wireless networks a survey</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper provides a comprehensive review of the domain of physical layer security in multiuser wireless networks. The essential premise of physical layer security is to enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers, without relying on higher-layer encryption. This can be achieved primarily in two ways: without the need for a secret key by intelligently designing transmit coding strategies, or by exploiting the wireless communication medium to develop secret keys over public channels. The survey begins with an overview of the foundations dating back to the pioneering work of Shannon and Wyner on information-theoretic security. We then describe the evolution of secure transmission strategies from point-to-point channels to multiple-antenna systems, followed by generalizations to multiuser broadcast, multiple-access, interference, and relay networks. Secret-key generation and establishment protocols based on physical layer mechanisms are subsequently covered. Approaches for secrecy based on channel coding design are then examined, along with a description of inter-disciplinary approaches based on game theory and stochastic geometry. The associated problem of physical layer message authentication is also briefly introduced. The survey concludes with observations on potential research directions in this area.</data>

      <data key="title">an adaptive secret key directed cryptographic scheme for secure transmission in wireless sensor networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are memory and bandwidth limited networks whose main goals are to maximize the network lifetime and minimize the energy consumption and transmission cost. To achieve these goals, dif ferent techniques of compression and clustering have been used. However, security is an open and major issue in WSNs for which different approaches are used, both in centralized and distributed WSNs' environments. This paper presents an adaptive cryptographic scheme for secure transmission of various sensitive parameters, sensed by wireless sensors to the fusion center for further processing in WSNs such as military networks. The proposed method encrypts the sensitive captured data of sensor nodes using various encryption procedures (bitxor operation, bits shuffling, and secret key based encryption) and then sends it to the fusion center. At the fusion center, the received encrypted data is decrypted for taking further necessary actions. The experimental results with complexity analysis, validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method in terms of security in WSNs.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The vast areas of applications for IoTs in future smart cities, industrial automation, smart transportation systems, and smart health facilities represent a thriving surface for several security attacks with enormous economic, environmental and societal impacts. This survey paper presents a review of several security challenges of emerging IoT networks and discusses some of the attacks and their countermeasures based on different domains in IoT networks. Most conventional security solutions for IoT networks are adopted from communication networks while noting the particular characteristics of IoT networks such as the huge number of nodes, heterogeneity of the network, and the limited energy, communication, and computation of the nodes, these conventional security methods are not really adequate. One important challenge toward utilizing common secret key-based cryptographic methods in very large scale IoT networks is the problem of secret key generation, distribution, and storage in IoT devices and more importantly protecting these secret keys from physical attacks. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are recently utilized as a promising hardware security solution for identification and authentication in IoT networks. Since PUFs extract the unique hardware characteristics, they potentially offer an affordable and practical solution for secret key generation. However, several barriers limit the applications of different types of PUFs for key generation purposes. We discuss the advantages of PUF-based key generation methods, review the state-of-the-art techniques in this field and propose a reliable PUF-based solution for secret key generation using resistive random-access memories (RERAMs) embedded in IoTs.</data>

      <data key="title">robust beamforming for secure communication in systems with wireless information and power transfer</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper considers a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In particular, we focus on secure communication in the presence of passive eavesdroppers and potential eavesdroppers (idle legitimate receivers). We study the design of a resource allocation algorithm minimizing the total transmit power for the case when the legitimate receivers are able to harvest energy from radio frequency signals. Our design advocates the dual use of both artificial noise and energy signals in providing secure communication and facilitating efficient wireless energy transfer. The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. The problem formulation takes into account artificial noise and energy signal generation for protecting the transmitted information against both considered types of eavesdroppers when imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the potential eavesdroppers and no CSI of the passive eavesdroppers are available at the transmitter. Besides, the problem formulation also takes into account different quality of service (QoS) requirements: a minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the desired receiver; maximum tolerable SINRs at the potential eavesdroppers; a minimum required outage probability at the passive eavesdroppers; and minimum required heterogeneous amounts of power transferred to the idle legitimate receivers. In light of the intractability of the problem, we reformulate the considered problem by replacing a non-convex probabilistic constraint with a convex deterministic constraint. Then, a semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation approach is adopted to obtain the optimal solution for the reformulated problem. Furthermore, we propose a suboptimal resource allocation scheme with low computational complexity for providing communication secrecy and facilitating efficient energy transfer. Simulation results demonstrate the close-to-optimal performance of the proposed schemes and significant transmit power savings by optimization of the artificial noise and energy signal generation.</data>

      <data key="title">awgn channel under time varying amplitude constraints with causal information at the transmitter</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider the classical AWGN channel where the channel input is constrained to an amplitude constraint that stochastically varies at each channel use, independent of the message. This is an abstraction of an energy harvesting transmitter where the code symbol energy at each channel use is determined by an exogenous energy arrival process and there is no battery for energy storage. At each channel use, an independent realization of the amplitude constraint process is observed by the transmitter causally. This scenario is a state-dependent channel with perfect causal state information at the transmitter. We derive the capacity of this channel using Shannon's coding scheme with causal state information. We prove that the code symbols must be selected from a finite set in the capacity achieving scheme, as in the case of Smith. We numerically study the binary on-off energy arrivals where the amplitude constraint is either zero or a non-zero constant.</data>
