      <data key="title">visual analytics for loan guarantee network risk management</data>
      <data key="abstract">Groups of enterprises guarantee each other and form complex guarantee networks when they try to obtain loans from banks. Such secured loan can enhance the solvency and promote the rapid growth in the economic upturn period. However, potential systemic risk may happen within the risk binding community. Especially, during the economic down period, the crisis may spread in the guarantee network like a domino. Monitoring the financial status, preventing or reducing systematic risk when crisis happens is highly concerned by the regulatory commission and banks. We propose visual analytics approach for loan guarantee network risk management, and consolidate the five analysis tasks with financial experts: i) visual analytics for enterprises default risk, whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and developed an interface to visualize key indicators; ii) visual analytics for high default groups, whereby a community detection based interactive approach is presented; iii) visual analytics for high defaults pattern, whereby a motif detection based interactive approach is described, and we adopt a Shneiderman Mantra strategy to reduce the computation complexity. iv) visual analytics for evolving guarantee network, whereby animation is used to help understanding the guarantee dynamic; v) visual analytics approach and interface for default diffusion path. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the government and bank to monitor the default spread status. It also provides insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systemic financial risk. We implement the system with case studies on a real-world guarantee network. Two financial experts are consulted with endorsement on the developed tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual analytics tool to explore the guarantee network risks in a systematic manner.</data>

      <data key="title">detecting problematic transactions in a consumer to consumer e commerce network</data>
      <data key="abstract">Providers of online marketplaces are constantly combatting against problematic transactions, such as selling illegal items and posting fictive items, exercised by some of their users. A typical approach to detect fraud activity has been to analyze registered user profiles, user's behavior, and texts attached to individual transactions and the user. However, this traditional approach may be limited because malicious users can easily conceal their information. Given this background, network indices have been exploited for detecting frauds in various online transaction platforms. In the present study, we analyzed networks of users of an online consumer-to-consumer marketplace in which a seller and the corresponding buyer of a transaction are connected by a directed edge. We constructed egocentric networks of each of several hundreds of fraudulent users and those of a similar number of normal users. We calculated eight local network indices based on up to connectivity between the neighbors of the focal node. Based on the present descriptive analysis of these network indices, we fed twelve features that we constructed from the eight network indices to random forest classifiers with the aim of distinguishing between normal users and fraudulent users engaged in each one of the four types of problematic transactions. We found that the classifier accurately distinguished the fraudulent users from normal users and that the classification performance did not depend on the type of problematic transaction.</data>

      <data key="title">detection of money laundering groups using supervised learning in networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Money laundering is a major global problem, enabling criminal organisations to hide their ill-gotten gains and to finance further operations. Prevention of money laundering is seen as a high priority by many governments, however detection of money laundering without prior knowledge of predicate crimes remains a significant challenge. Previous detection systems have tended to focus on individuals, considering transaction histories and applying anomaly detection to identify suspicious behaviour. However, money laundering involves groups of collaborating individuals, and evidence of money laundering may only be apparent when the collective behaviour of these groups is considered. In this paper we describe a detection system that is capable of analysing group behaviour, using a combination of network analysis and supervised learning. This system is designed for real-world application and operates on networks consisting of millions of interacting parties. Evaluation of the system using real-world data indicates that suspicious activity is successfully detected. Importantly, the system exhibits a low rate of false positives, and is therefore suitable for use in a live intelligence environment.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Massive content about user's social, personal and professional life stored on Online Social Networks (OSNs) has attracted not only the attention of researchers and social analysts but also the cyber criminals. These cyber criminals penetrate illegally into an OSN by establishing fake profiles or by designing bots and exploit the vulnerabilities of an OSN to carry out illegal activities. With the growth of technology cyber crimes have been increasing manifold. Daily reports of the security and privacy threats in the OSNs demand not only the intelligent automated detection systems that can identify and alleviate fake profiles in real time but also the reinforcement of the security and privacy laws to curtail the cyber crime. In this paper, we have studied various categories of fake profiles like compromised profiles, cloned profiles and online bots (spam-bots, social-bots, like-bots and influential-bots) on different OSN sites along with existing cyber laws to mitigate their threats. In order to design fake profile detection systems, we have highlighted different category of fake profile features which are capable to distinguish different kinds of fake entities from real ones. Another major challenges faced by researchers while building the fake profile detection systems is the unavailability of data specific to fake users. The paper addresses this challenge by providing extremely obliging data collection techniques along with some existing data sources. Furthermore, an attempt is made to present several machine learning techniques employed to design different fake profile detection systems.</data>

In this paper, trust networks using blind carbon copy (BCC) emails were formed. We show that our new shortest paths network search algorithm combining shortest paths and network centrality measures can isolate and identify criminals' connections within a trust network. A group of BCC emails out of 1,887,305 Enron email transactions were isolated for this purpose. The algorithm uses two central nodes, most influential and middle man, to extract a shortest paths trust network.</data>

      <data key="title">change detection in dynamic attributed networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">A network provides powerful means of representing complex relationships between entities by abstracting entities as vertices, and relationships as edges connecting vertices in a graph. Beyond the presence or absence of relationships, a network may contain additional information that can be attributed to the entities and their relationships. Attaching these additional attribute data to the corresponding vertices and edges yields an attributed graph. Moreover, in the majority of real-world applications, such as online social networks, financial networks and transactional networks, relationships between entities evolve over time. #R##N#Change detection in dynamic attributed networks is an important problem in many areas, such as fraud detection, cyber intrusion detection and health care monitoring. It is a challenging problem because it involves a time sequence of attributed graphs, each of which is usually very large and can contain many attributes attached to the vertices and edges, resulting in a complex, high dimensional mathematical object. #R##N#In this survey we provide an overview of some of the existing change detection methods that utilize attribute information. We categorize these methods based on the levels of structure in the graph that are exploited to detect changes. These levels are vertices, edges, subgraphs, communities and the overall graph. We focus our attention on the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, including performance and scalability. Finally we discuss some publicly available dynamic network datasets and give a brief overview of simulation models to generate synthetic dynamic attributed networks.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Pervasive Online Social Networks (POSNs) are the extensions of Online Social Networks (OSNs) which facilitate connectivity irrespective of the domain and properties of users. POSNs have been accumulated with the convergence of a plethora of social networking platforms with a motivation of bridging their gap. Over the last decade, OSNs have visually perceived an altogether tremendous amount of advancement in terms of the number of users as well as technology enablers. A single OSN is the property of an organization, which ascertains smooth functioning of its accommodations for providing a quality experience to their users. However, with POSNs, multiple OSNs have coalesced through communities, circles, or only properties, which make service-provisioning tedious and arduous to sustain. Especially, challenges become rigorous when the focus is on the security perspective of cross-platform OSNs, which are an integral part of POSNs. Thus, it is of utmost paramountcy to highlight such a requirement and understand the current situation while discussing the available state-of-the-art. With the modernization of OSNs and convergence towards POSNs, it is compulsory to understand the impact and reach of current solutions for enhancing the security of users as well as associated services. This survey understands this requisite and fixates on different sets of studies presented over the last few years and surveys them for their applicability to POSNs...</data>

      <data key="title">ranking the importance level of intermediaries to a criminal using a reliance measure</data>
      <data key="abstract">Recent research on finding important intermediate nodes in a network suspected to contain criminal activity is highly dependent on network centrality values. Betweenness centrality, for example, is widely used to rank the nodes that act as brokers in the shortest paths connecting all source and all the end nodes in a network. However both the shortest path node betweenness and the linearly scaled betweenness can only show rankings for all the nodes in a network. In this paper we explore the mathematical concept of pair-dependency on intermediate nodes, adapting the concept to criminal relationships and introducing a new source-intermediate reliance measure. To illustrate our measure, we apply it to rank the nodes in the Enron email dataset and the Noordin Top Terrorist networks. We compare the reliance ranking with Google PageRank, Markov centrality as well as betweenness centrality and show that a criminal investigation using the reliance measure, will lead to a different prioritisation in terms of possible people to investigate. While the ranking for the Noordin Top terrorist network nodes yields more extreme differences than for the Enron email transaction network, in the latter the reliance values for the set of finance managers immediately identified another employee convicted of money laundering.</data>

Anomalies in online social networks can signify irregular, and often illegal behaviour. Detection of such anomalies has been used to identify malicious individuals, including spammers, sexual predators, and online fraudsters. In this paper we survey existing computational techniques for detecting anomalies in online social networks. We characterise anomalies as being either static or dynamic, and as being labelled or unlabelled, and survey methods for detecting these different types of anomalies. We suggest that the detection of anomalies in online social networks is composed of two sub-processes; the selection and calculation of network features, and the classification of observations from this feature space. In addition, this paper provides an overview of the types of problems that anomaly detection can address and identifies key areas of future research.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Use of social network is the basic functionality of today's life. With the advent of more and more online social media, the information available and its utilization have come under the threat of several anomalies. Anomalies are the major cause of online frauds which allow information access by unauthorized users as well as information forging. One of the anomalies that act as a silent attacker is the horizontal anomaly. These are the anomalies caused by a user because of his/her variable behavior towards different sources. Horizontal anomalies are difficult to detect and hazardous for any network. In this paper, a self-healing neuro-fuzzy approach (NHAD) is used for the detection, recovery, and removal of horizontal anomalies efficiently and accurately. The proposed approach operates over the five paradigms, namely, missing links, reputation gain, significant difference, trust properties, and trust score. The proposed approach is evaluated with three datasets: DARPA'98 benchmark dataset, synthetic dataset, and real-time traffic. Results show that the accuracy of the proposed NHAD model for 10 to 30 percent anomalies in synthetic dataset ranges between 98.08 and 99.88 percent. The evaluation over DARPA'98 dataset demonstrates that the proposed approach is better than the existing solutions as it provides 99.97 percent detection rate for anomalous class. For real-time traffic, the proposed NHAD model operates with an average accuracy of 99.42 at 99.90 percent detection rate.</data>

The usage of communication media such as mobile phones and online social networks leaves digital traces in the form of metadata that can be used for this type of analysis. The goal of this work is twofold: first we provide a theoretical framework for the problem of detecting and characterizing criminal organizations in networks reconstructed from phone call records. Then, we introduce an expert system to support law enforcement agencies in the task of unveiling the underlying structure of criminal networks hidden in communication data. This platform allows for statistical network analysis, community detection and visual exploration of mobile phone network data. It enables forensic investigators to deeply understand hierarchies within criminal organizations, discovering members who play central role and provide connection among sub-groups.

      <data key="title">deep representation learning for social network analysis</data>
      <data key="abstract">Social network analysis is an important problem in data mining. A fundamental step for analyzing social networks is to encode network data into low-dimensional representations, i.e., network embeddings, so that the network topology structure and other attribute information can be effectively preserved. Network representation leaning facilitates further applications such as classification, link prediction, anomaly detection and clustering. In addition, techniques based on deep neural networks have attracted great interests over the past a few years. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of current literature in network representation learning utilizing neural network models. First, we introduce the basic models for learning node representations in homogeneous networks. Meanwhile, we will also introduce some extensions of the base models in tackling more complex scenarios, such as analyzing attributed networks, heterogeneous networks and dynamic networks. Then, we introduce the techniques for embedding subgraphs. After that, we present the applications of network representation learning. At the end, we discuss some promising research directions for future work.</data>

      <data key="title">using shortest path to discover criminal community</data>
      <data key="abstract">Extracting communities using existing community detection algorithms yields dense sub-networks that are difficult to analyse. Extracting a smaller sample that embodies the relationships of a list of suspects is an important part of the beginning of an investigation. In this paper, we present the efficacy of our shortest paths network search algorithm (SPNSA) that begins with an 'algorithm feed', a small subset of nodes of particular interest, and builds an investigative sub-network. The algorithm feed may consist of known criminals or suspects, or persons of influence. This sets our approach apart from existing community detection algorithms. We apply the SPNSA on the Enron Dataset of e-mail communications starting with those convicted of money laundering in relation to the collapse of Enron as the algorithm feed. The algorithm produces sparse and small sub-networks that could feasibly identify a list of persons and relationships to be further investigated. In contrast, we show that identifying sub-networks of interest using either existing community detection algorithms or a k-Neighbourhood approach produces sub-networks of much larger size and complexity. When the 18 top managers of Enron were used as the algorithm feed, the resulting sub-network identified 4 convicted criminals that were not managers and so not part of the algorithm feed. We directly validate the SPNSA by removing one of the convicted criminals from the algorithm feed and re-running the algorithm; in 5 out of 9 cases the left out criminal occurred in the resulting sub-network.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In today's technological society there are various new means to commit fraud due to the advancement of media and communication networks. One typical fraud is the ATM phone scams. The commonality of ATM phone scams is basically to attract victims to use financial institutions or ATMs to transfer their money into fraudulent accounts. Regardless of the types of fraud used, fraudsters can only collect victims' money through fraudulent accounts. Therefore, it is very important to identify the signs of such fraudulent accounts and to detect fraudulent accounts based on these signs, in order to reduce victims' losses. This study applied Bayesian Classification and Association Rule to identify the signs of fraudulent accounts and the patterns of fraudulent transactions. Detection rules were developed based on the identified signs and applied to the design of a fraudulent account detection system. Empirical verification supported that this fraudulent account detection system can successfully identify fraudulent accounts in early stages and is able to provide reference for financial institutions.</data>

The system is described and examined in great detail, several technical difficulties in detecting fraud are also considered, for it to be applicable in practice. Opposed to many other approaches, the system uses networks for representation of data. Networks are the most natural representation of such a relational domain, allowing formulation and analysis of complex relations between entities. Fraudulent entities are found by employing a novel assessment algorithm, Iterative Assessment Algorithm (IAA), also presented in the article. Besides intrinsic attributes of entities, the algorithm explores also the relations between entities. The prototype was evaluated and rigorously analyzed on real world data. Results show that automobile insurance fraud can be efficiently detected with the proposed system and that appropriate data representation is vital.</data>
