      <data key="title">least squares registration of point sets over se d using closed form projections</data>
      <data key="abstract">Consider the problem of registering multiple point sets in some $d$-dimensional space using rotations and translations. Assume that there are sets with common points, and moreover the pairwise correspondences are known for such sets. We consider a least-squares formulation of this problem, where the variables are the transforms associated with the point sets. The present novelty is that we reduce this nonconvex problem to an optimization over the positive semidefinite cone, where the objective is linear but the constraints are nevertheless nonconvex. We propose to solve this using variable splitting and the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM). Due to the linearity of the objective and the structure of constraints, the ADMM subproblems are given by projections with closed-form solutions. In particular, for $m$ point sets, the dominant cost per iteration is the partial eigendecomposition of an $md \times md$ matrix, and $m-1$ singular value decompositions of $d \times d$ matrices. We empirically show that for appropriate parameter settings, the proposed solver has a large convergence basin and is stable under perturbations. As applications, we use our method for $2$D shape matching and $3$D multiview registration. In either application, we model the shapes/scans as point sets and determine the pairwise correspondences using ICP. In particular, our algorithm compares favorably with existing methods for multiview reconstruction in terms of timing and accuracy.</data>

      <data key="title">effective scaling registration approach by imposing the emphasis on the scale factor</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper proposes an effective approach for the scaling registration of $m$-D point sets. Different from the rigid transformation, the scaling registration can not be formulated into the common least square function due to the ill-posed problem caused by the scale factor. Therefore, this paper designs a novel objective function for the scaling registration problem. The appearance of this objective function is a rational fraction, where the numerator item is the least square error and the denominator item is the square of the scale factor. By imposing the emphasis on scale factor, the ill-posed problem can be avoided in the scaling registration. Subsequently, the new objective function can be solved by the proposed scaling iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which can obtain the optimal scaling transformation. For the practical applications, the scaling ICP algorithm is further extended to align partially overlapping point sets. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on public data sets and applied to merging grid maps of different resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over previous approaches on efficiency and robustness.</data>

      <data key="title">registration of multi view point sets under the perspective of expectation maximization</data>
      <data key="abstract">Registration of multi-view point sets is a prerequisite for 3D model reconstruction. To solve this problem, most of previous approaches either partially explore available information or blindly utilize unnecessary information to align each point set, which may lead to the undesired results or introduce extra computation complexity. To this end, this paper consider the multi-view registration problem as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and proposes a novel multi-view registration approach under the perspective of Expectation-Maximization (EM). The basic idea of our approach is that different data points are generated by the same number of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). For each data point in one well-aligned point set, its nearest neighbors can be searched from other well-aligned point sets to explore more available information. Then, we can suppose this data point is generated by the special GMM, which is composed of each of its nearest neighbor adhered with one Gaussian distribution. Based on this assumption, it is reasonable to define the likelihood function, which contains all rigid transformations required to be estimated for multi-view registration. Subsequently, the EM algorithm is utilized to maximize the likelihood function so as to estimate all rigid transformations. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on several bench mark data sets and compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results illustrate its super performance on accuracy and efficiency for the registration of multi-view point sets.</data>

      <data key="title">cooperative relative positioning of mobile users by fusing imu inertial and uwb ranging information</data>
      <data key="abstract">Relative positioning between multiple mobile users is essential for many applications, such as search and rescue in disaster areas or human social interaction. Inertial-measurement unit (IMU) is promising to determine the change of position over short periods of time, but it is very sensitive to error accumulation over long term run. By equipping the mobile users with ranging unit, e.g. ultra-wideband (UWB), it is possible to achieve accurate relative positioning by trilateration-based approaches. As compared to vision or laser-based sensors, the UWB does not need to be with in line-of-sight and provides accurate distance estimation. However, UWB does not provide any bearing information and the communication range is limited, thus UWB alone cannot determine the user location without any ambiguity. In this paper, we propose an approach to combine IMU inertial and UWB ranging measurement for relative positioning between multiple mobile users without the knowledge of the infrastructure. We incorporate the UWB and the IMU measurement into a probabilistic-based framework, which allows to cooperatively position a group of mobile users and recover from positioning failures. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating IMU inertial and UWB ranging measurements.</data>

      <data key="title">information correlated levy walk exploration and distributed mapping using a swarm of robots</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this work, we present a novel distributed method for constructing an occupancy grid map of an unknown environment using a swarm of robots with global localization capabilities and limited inter-robot communication. The robots explore the domain by performing L\'evy walks in which their headings are defined by maximizing the mutual information between the robot's estimate of its environment in the form of an occupancy grid map and the distance measurements that it is likely to obtain when it moves in that direction. Each robot is equipped with laser range sensors, and it builds its occupancy grid map by repeatedly combining its own distance measurements with map information that is broadcast by neighboring robots. Using results on average consensus over time-varying graph topologies, we prove that all robots' maps will eventually converge to the actual map of the environment. In addition, we demonstrate that a technique based on topological data analysis, developed in our previous work for generating topological maps, can be readily extended for adaptive thresholding of occupancy grid maps. We validate the effectiveness of our distributed exploration and mapping strategy through a series of 2D simulations and multi-robot experiments.</data>

      <data key="title">outlier robust icp for minimizing fractional rmsd</data>
      <data key="abstract">We describe a variation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm for aligning two point sets under a set of transformations. Our algorithm is superior to previous algorithms because (1) in determining the optimal alignment, it identifies and discards likely outliers in a statistically robust manner, and (2) it is guaranteed to converge to a locally optimal solution. To this end, we formalize a new distance measure, fractional root mean squared distance (frmsd), which incorporates the fraction of inliers into the distance function. We lay out a specific implementation, but our framework can easily incorporate most techniques and heuristics from modern registration algorithms. We experimentally validate our algorithm against previous techniques on 2 and 3 dimensional data exposed to a variety of outlier types.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We introduce a novel low level feature for identifying cover songs which quantifies the relative changes in the smoothed frequency spectrum of a song. Our key insight is that a sliding window representation of a chunk of audio can be viewed as a time-ordered point cloud in high dimensions. For corresponding chunks of audio between different versions of the same song, these point clouds are approximately rotated, translated, and scaled copies of each other. If we treat MFCC embeddings as point clouds and cast the problem as a relative shape sequence, we are able to correctly identify 42/80 cover songs in the "Covers 80" dataset. By contrast, all other work to date on cover songs exclusively relies on matching note sequences from Chroma derived features.</data>

      <data key="title">globally optimal registration of noisy point clouds</data>
      <data key="abstract">Registration of 3D point clouds is a fundamental task in several applications of robotics and computer vision. While registration methods such as iterative closest point and variants are very popular, they are only locally optimal. There has been some recent work on globally optimal registration, but they perform poorly in the presence of noise in the measurements. In this work we develop a mixed integer programming-based approach for globally optimal registration that explicitly considers uncertainty in its optimization, and hence produces more accurate estimates. Furthermore, from a practical implementation perspective we develop a multi-step optimization that combines fast local methods with our accurate global formulation. Through extensive simulation and real world experiments we demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods for various level of noise and outliers in the data as well as for partial geometric overlap.</data>

      <data key="title">point set registration coherent point drift</data>
      <data key="abstract">Point set registration is a key component in many computer vision tasks. The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</data>

      <data key="title">analysis of robust functions for registration algorithms</data>
      <data key="abstract">Registration accuracy is influenced by the presence of outliers and numerous robust solutions have been developed over the years to mitigate their effect. However, without a large scale comparison of solutions to filter outliers, it is becoming tedious to select an appropriate algorithm for a given application. This paper presents a comprehensive analyses of the effects of outlier filters on the ICP algorithm aimed at mobile robotic application. Fourteen of the most common outlier filters (such as M-estimators) have been tested in different types of environments, for a total of more than two million registrations. Furthermore, the influence of tuning parameters have been thoroughly explored. The experimental results show that most outlier filters have similar performance if they are correctly tuned. Nonetheless, filters such as Var. Trim., Cauchy, and Cauchy MAD are more stable against different environment types. Interestingly, the simple norm L1 produces comparable accuracy, while been parameterless.</data>

      <data key="title">simultaneous merging multiple grid maps using the robust motion averaging</data>
      <data key="abstract">Mapping in the GPS-denied environment is an important and challenging task in the field of robotics. In the large environment, mapping can be significantly accelerated by multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. Accordingly, a key problem is how to integrate these local maps built by different robots into a single global map. In this paper, we propose an approach for simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps by the robust motion averaging. The main idea of this approach is to recover all global motions for map merging from a set of relative motions. Therefore, it firstly adopts the pair-wise map merging method to estimate relative motions for grid map pairs. To obtain as many reliable relative motions as possible, a graph-based sampling scheme is utilized to efficiently remove unreliable relative motions obtained from the pair-wise map merging. Subsequently, the accurate global motions can be recovered from the set of reliable relative motions by the motion averaging. Experimental results carried on real robot data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps with good performances.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) has become a promising choice for indoor positioning as the only existing and established infrastructure, to localize the mobile and stationary users indoors. However, since WLAN has been initially designed for wireless networking and not positioning, the localization task based on WLAN signals has several challenges. Amongst the WLAN positioning methods, WLAN fingerprinting localization has recently achieved great attention due to its promising results. WLAN fingerprinting faces several challenges and hence, in this paper, our goal is to overview these challenges and the state-of-the-art solutions. This paper consists of three main parts: 1) Conventional localization schemes; 2) State-of-the-art approaches; 3) Practical deployment challenges. Since all the proposed methods in WLAN literature have been conducted and tested in different settings, the reported results are not equally comparable. So, we compare some of the main localization schemes in a single real environment and assess their localization accuracy, positioning error statistics, and complexity. Our results depict illustrative evaluation of WLAN localization systems and guide to future improvement opportunities.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The SLAM problem is known to have a special property that when robot orientation is known, estimating the history of robot poses and feature locations can be posed as a standard linear least squares problem. In this work, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative feature-to-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational burden of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for feature-based SLAM. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver.</data>

      <data key="abstract">When registering point clouds resolved from an underlying 2-D pixel structure, such as those resulting from structured light and flash LiDAR sensors, or stereo reconstruction, it is expected that some points in one cloud do not have corresponding points in the other cloud, and that these would occur together, such as along an edge of the depth map. In this work, a hidden Markov random field model is used to capture this prior within the framework of the iterative closest point algorithm. The EM algorithm is used to estimate the distribution parameters and the hidden component memberships. Experiments are presented demonstrating that this method outperforms several other outlier rejection methods when the point clouds have low or moderate overlap.</data>

      <data key="title">collaborative slam based on wifi fingerprint similarity and motion information</data>
      <data key="abstract">Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been extensively researched in past years particularly with regard to range-based or visual-based sensors. Instead of deploying dedicated devices that use visual features, it is more pragmatic to exploit the radio features to achieve this task, due to their ubiquitous nature and the widespread deployment of Wi-Fi wireless network. This paper presents a novel approach for collaborative simultaneous localization and radio fingerprint mapping (C-SLAM-RF) in large unknown indoor environments. The proposed system uses received signal strengths (RSS) from Wi-Fi access points (AP) in the existing infrastructure and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) from a smart phone, without a prior knowledge about map or distribution of AP in the environment. We claim a loop closure based on the similarity of the two radio fingerprints. To further improve the performance, we incorporate the turning motion and assign a small uncertainty value to a loop closure if a matched turning is identified. The experiment was done in an area of 130 meters by 70 meters and the results show that our proposed system is capable of estimating the tracks of four users with an accuracy of 0.6 meters with Tango-based PDR and 4.76 meters with a step counter-based PDR.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) consists in the concurrent construction of a model of the environment (the  map ), and the estimation of the state of the robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM and consider future directions. We start by presenting what is now the  de-facto  standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors’ take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences:  Do robots need SLAM?  and  Is SLAM solved?</data>

      <data key="abstract">Point cloud registration sits at the core of many important and challenging 3D perception problems including autonomous navigation, SLAM, object/scene recognition, and augmented reality. In this paper, we present a new registration algorithm that is able to achieve state-of-the-art speed and accuracy through its use of a hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) representation. Our method constructs a top-down multi-scale representation of point cloud data by recursively running many small-scale data likelihood segmentations in parallel on a GPU. We leverage the resulting representation using a novel PCA-based optimization criterion that adaptively finds the best scale to perform data association between spatial subsets of point cloud data. Compared to previous Iterative Closest Point and GMM-based techniques, our tree-based point association algorithm performs data association in logarithmic-time while dynamically adjusting the level of detail to best match the complexity and spatial distribution characteristics of local scene geometry. In addition, unlike other GMM methods that restrict covariances to be isotropic, our new PCA-based optimization criterion well-approximates the true MLE solution even when fully anisotropic Gaussian covariances are used. Efficient data association, multi-scale adaptability, and a robust MLE approximation produce an algorithm that is up to an order of magnitude both faster and more accurate than current state-of-the-art on a wide variety of 3D datasets captured from LiDAR to structured light.</data>

The proposed robust mapping technique constructs a topological map of the environment using only encounter information from the swarm. A sliding window strategy is adopted in conjunction with a topological mapping strategy based on local interactions among the swarm in a coordinate-free fashion to obtain local maps of the environment. These maps are then merged into a global topological map which can be visualized using a graphical representation that integrates geometric as well as topological feature of the environment. Localized robust topological features are extracted using tools from topological data analysis.

      <data key="title">sdrsac semidefinite based randomized approach for robust point cloud registration without correspondences</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper presents a novel randomized algorithm for robust point cloud registration without correspondences. Most existing registration approaches require a set of putative correspondences obtained by extracting invariant descriptors. However, such descriptors could become unreliable in noisy and contaminated settings. In these settings, methods that directly handle input point sets are preferable. Without correspondences, however, conventional randomized techniques require a very large number of samples in order to reach satisfactory solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem. In particular, our work enables the use of randomized methods for point cloud registration without the need of putative correspondences. By considering point cloud alignment as a special instance of graph matching and employing an efficient semi-definite relaxation, we propose a novel sampling mechanism, in which the size of the sampled subsets can be larger-than-minimal. Our tight relaxation scheme enables fast rejection of the outliers in the sampled sets, resulting in high-quality hypotheses. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, our proposed method serves as a generic framework which can be extended to problems with known correspondences.</data>
