      <data key="abstract">$\renewcommand{\Re}{{\rm I\!\hspace{-0.025em} R}} \newcommand{\SetX}{\mathsf{X}} \newcommand{\VorX}[1]{\mathcal{V} \pth{#1}} \newcommand{\Polygon}{\mathsf{P}} \newcommand{\Space}{\overline{\mathsf{m}}} \newcommand{\pth}[2][\!]{#1\left({#2}\right)}$ We resolve an open problem due to Tetsuo Asano, showing how to compute the shortest path in a polygon, given in a read only memory, using sublinear space and subquadratic time. Specifically, given a simple polygon $\Polygon$ with $n$ vertices in a read only memory, and additional working memory of size $\Space$, the new algorithm computes the shortest path (in $\Polygon$) in $O( n^2 /\, \Space )$ expected time. This requires several new tools, which we believe to be of independent interest.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The {\em compressed stack} is a data structure designed by Barba {\em et al.} (Algorithmica 2015) that allows to reduce the amount of memory needed by an algorithm (at the cost of increasing its runtime). In this paper we introduce the first implementation of this data structure and make its source code publicly available. #R##N#Together with the implementation we analyze the performance of the compressed stack. In our synthetic experiments, considering different test scenarios and using data sizes ranging up to $2^{30}$ elements, we compare it with the classic (uncompressed) stack, both in terms of runtime and memory used. #R##N#Our experiments show that the compressed stack needs significantly less memory than the usual stack (this difference is significant for inputs containing $2000$ or more elements). Overall, with a proper choice of parameters, we can save a significant amount of space (from two to four orders of magnitude) with a small increase in the runtime ($2.32$ times slower on average than the classic stack). These results holds even in test scenarios specifically designed to be challenging for the compressed stack.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present several algorithms for computing the visibility polygon of a simple polygon $P$ from a viewpoint inside the polygon, when the polygon resides in read-only memory and only few working variables can be used. The first algorithm uses a constant number of variables, and outputs the vertices of the visibility polygon in $O(n\Rout)$ time, where $\Rout$ denotes the number of reflex vertices of $P$ that are part of the output. The next two algorithms use $O(\log \Rin)$ variables, and output the visibility polygon in $O(n\log \Rin)$ randomized expected time or $O(n\log^2 \Rin)$ deterministic time, where $\Rin$ is the number of reflex vertices of $P$.</data>

      <data key="title">approximation schemes for independent set and sparse subsets of polygons</data>
      <data key="abstract">We present an $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with quasi-polynomial running time for computing the maximum weight independent set of polygons out of a given set of polygons in the plane (specifically, the running time is $n^{O( \mathrm{poly}( \log n, 1/\varepsilon))}$). Contrasting this, the best known polynomial time algorithm for the problem has an approximation ratio of~$n^{\varepsilon}$. Surprisingly, we can extend the algorithm to the problem of computing the maximum weight subset of the given set of polygons whose intersection graph fulfills some sparsity condition. For example, we show that one can approximate the maximum weight subset of polygons, such that the intersection graph of the subset is planar or does not contain a cycle of length $4$ (i.e., $K_{2,2}$). Our algorithm relies on a recursive partitioning scheme, whose backbone is the existence of balanced cuts with small complexity that intersect polygons from the optimal solution of a small total weight. #R##N#For the case of large axis-parallel rectangles, we provide a polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the maximum weight independent set. Specifically, we consider the problem where each rectangle has one edge whose length is at least a constant fraction of the length of the corresponding edge of the bounding box of all the input elements. This is now the most general case for which a PTAS is known, and it requires a new and involved partitioning scheme, which should be of independent interest.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present an extension of Voronoi diagrams where when considering which site a client is going to use, in addition to the site distances, other site attributes are also considered (for example, prices or weights). A cell in this diagram is then the locus of all clients that consider the same set of sites to be relevant. In particular, the precise site a client might use from this candidate set depends on parameters that might change between usages, and the candidate set lists all of the relevant sites. The resulting diagram is significantly more expressive than Voronoi diagrams, but naturally has the drawback that its complexity, even in the plane, might be quite high. Nevertheless, we show that if the attributes of the sites are drawn from the same distribution (note that the locations are fixed), then the expected complexity of the candidate diagram is near linear. #R##N#To this end, we derive several new technical results, which are of independent interest. In particular, we provide a high-probability, asymptotically optimal bound on the number of Pareto optima points in a point set uniformly sampled from the $d$-dimensional hypercube. To do so we revisit the classical backward analysis technique, both simplifying and improving relevant results in order to achieve the high-probability bounds.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We describe the first algorithm to compute the outer common tangents of two disjoint simple polygons using linear time and only constant workspace. A tangent of a polygon is a line touching the polygon such that all of the polygon lies on the same side of the line. An outer common tangent of two polygons is a tangent of both polygons such that the polygons lie on the same side of the tangent. Each polygon is given as a read-only array of its corners in cyclic order. The algorithm detects if an outer common tangent does not exist, which is the case if and only if the convex hull of one of the polygons is contained in the convex hull of the other. Otherwise, two corners defining an outer common tangent are returned.</data>

Classical algorithms for them typically use DFS and some $\Omega (\lg n)$ bits\footnote{We use $\lg$ to denote logarithm to the base $2$.} of information at each vertex. Building on a recent $O(n)$-bits implementation of DFS due to Elmasry et al. (STACS 2015) we provide $O(n)$-bit implementations for all these applications of DFS. Our algorithms take $O(m \lg^c n \lg\lg n)$ time for some small constant $c$ (where $c \leq 2$). Central to our implementation is a succinct representation of the DFS tree and a space efficient partitioning of the DFS tree into connected subtrees, which maybe of independent interest for designing other space efficient graph algorithms.</data>

      <data key="title">time space trade off for finding the k visibility region of a point in a polygon</data>
      <data key="abstract">We study the problem of computing the k-visibility region in the memory-constrained model. In this model, the input resides in a randomly accessible read-only memory of O(n) words, with \(O(\log {n})\) bits each. An algorithm can read and write O(s) additional words of workspace during its execution, and it writes its output to write-only memory. In a given polygon P and for a given point \(q \in P\), we say that a point p is inside the k-visibility region of q, if and only if the line segment pq intersects the boundary of P at most k times. Given a simple n-vertex polygon P stored in a read-only input array and a point \(q \in P\), we give a time-space trade-off algorithm which reports the k-visibility region of q in P in \(O(cn/s+n\log {s}+ \min \{{\lceil k/s \rceil n,n \log {\log _s{n}}}\})\) expected time using O(s) words of workspace. Here \(c\le n\) is the number of critical vertices for q, i.e., the vertices of P where the visibility region may change. We also show how to generalize this result for polygons with holes and for sets of non-crossing line segments.</data>

      <data key="title">improved time space trade offs for computing voronoi diagrams</data>
      <data key="abstract">Let $P$ be a planar set of $n$ sites in general position. For $k \in \{1, \dots, n-1\}$, the Voronoi diagram of order $k$ for $P$ is obtained by subdividing the plane into cells such that points in the same cell have the same set of nearest $k$ neighbors in $P$. The (nearest site) Voronoi diagram (NVD) and the farthest site Voronoi diagram (FVD) are the particular cases of $k=1$ and $k=n-1$, respectively. For any given $K \in \{1, \dots, n-1\}$, the family of all higher-order Voronoi diagrams of order $k = 1, \dots, K$ for $P$ can be computed in total time $O(nK^2+ n \log n)$ using $O(K^2(n-K))$ space [Aggarwal et al., DCG'89; Lee, TC'82]. Moreover, NVD and FVD for $P$ can be computed in $O(n\log n)$ time using $O(n)$ space [Preparata, Shamos, Springer'85].  For $s \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, an $s$-workspace algorithm has random access to a read-only array with the sites of $P$ in arbitrary order. Additionally, the algorithm may use $O(s)$ words, of $\Theta(\log n)$ bits each, for reading and writing intermediate data. The output can be written only once and cannot be accessed or modified afterwards.  We describe a deterministic $s$-workspace algorithm for computing NVD and FVD for $P$ that runs in $O((n^2/s)\log s)$ time. Moreover, we generalize our $s$-workspace algorithm so that for any given $K \in O(\sqrt{s})$, we compute the family of all higher-order Voronoi diagrams of order $k = 1, \dots, K$ for $P$ in total expected time $O\bigl(\frac{n^2 K^5}{s}(\log s + K \, 2^{O(\log^* K)}) \bigr)$ or in total deterministic time $O\bigl(\frac{n^2 K^5}{s}(\log s + K \log K) \bigr)$. Previously, for Voronoi diagrams, the only known $s$-workspace algorithm runs in expected time $O\bigl((n^2/s) \log s + n \log s \log^*s\bigr)$ [Korman et al., WADS'15] and only works for NVD (i.e., $k=1$). Unlike the previous algorithm, our new method is very simple and does not rely on advanced data structures or random sampling techniques.</data>

For bottom-vertex triangulation, both the primal shatter dimension and the combinatorial dimension are $\Theta(d^2)$, but there seems to be a significant gap between them, as the combinatorial dimension is $\frac12d(d+3)$, whereas the primal shatter dimension is at most $d(d+1)$, and the VC-dimension is between $d(d+1)$ and $5d^2 \log{d}$ (for $d\ge 9$). #R##N#Our main application is to point location in an arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes is $\Re^d$, in which we show that the query cost in Meiser's algorithm can be improved if one uses vertical decomposition instead of bottom-vertex triangulation, at the cost of some increase in the preprocessing cost and storage. The best query time that we can obtain is $O(d^3\log n)$, instead of $O(d^4\log d\log n)$ in Meiser's algorithm. For these bounds to hold, the preprocessing and storage are rather large (super-exponential in $d$).

      <data key="abstract">We consider space-bounded computations on a random-access machine (RAM) where the input is given on a read-only random-access medium, the output is to be produced to a write-only sequential-access medium, and the available workspace allows random reads and writes but is of limited capacity. The length of the input is $N$ elements, the length of the output is limited by the computation, and the capacity of the workspace is $O(S)$ bits for some predetermined parameter $S$. We present a state-of-the-art priority queue---called an adjustable navigation pile---for this restricted RAM model. Under some reasonable assumptions, our priority queue supports $\mathit{minimum}$ and $\mathit{insert}$ in $O(1)$ worst-case time and $\mathit{extract}$ in $O(N/S + \lg{} S)$ worst-case time for any $S \geq \lg{} N$. We show how to use this data structure to sort $N$ elements and to compute the convex hull of $N$ points in the two-dimensional Euclidean space in $O(N^2/S + N \lg{} S)$ worst-case time for any $S \geq \lg{} N$. Following a known lower bound for the space-time product of any branching program for finding unique elements, both our sorting and convex-hull algorithms are optimal. The adjustable navigation pile has turned out to be useful when designing other space-efficient algorithms, and we expect that it will find its way to yet other applications.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Recent work by Elmasry et al. (STACS 2015) and Asano et al. (ISAAC 2014), reconsidered classical fundamental graph algorithms focusing on improving the space complexity. We continue this line of work focusing on space. Our first result is a simple data structure that can maintain any subset $S$ of a universe of $n$ elements using $n+o(n)$ bits and support in constant time, apart from the standard insert, delete and membership queries, the operation {\it findany} that finds and returns any element of the set (or outputs that the set is empty). Using this we give a BFS implementation that takes $O(m+n)$ time using at most $2n+o(n)$ bits. Later, we further improve the space requirement of BFS to at most $1.585n + o(n)$ bits. We demonstrate the use of our data structure by developing another data structure using it that can represent a sequence of $n$ non-negative integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$ using at most $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + 2n + o(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i+n)$ bits and, in constant time, determine whether the $i$-th element is $0$ or decrement it otherwise. We also discuss an algorithm for finding a minimum weight spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph using at most $n+o(n)$ bits. For DFS, we have two kinds of results. Specifically, we provide an implementation for DFS that takes $O(m+n)$ time using $O(m+n)$ bits. Using the DFS algorithm and other careful implementations, we can determine cut vertices, bridges and maximal 2-connected components among others, in $O(m+n)$ time and $O(m+n)$ bits. We also present space efficient implementations for finding strongly connected components, topological sort, and a sparse biconnected subgraph of a biconnected graph using $O(n)$ bits.

In this paper we introduce the compressed stack technique, a method that allows to transform algorithms whose space bottleneck is a stack into memory-constrained algorithms. Given an algorithm \alg\ that runs in O(n) time using $\Theta(n)$ variables, we can modify it so that it runs in $O(n^2/s)$ time using a workspace of O(s) variables (for any $s\in o(\log n)$) or $O(n\log n/\log p)$ time using $O(p\log n/\log p)$ variables (for any $2\leq p\leq n$). We also show how the technique can be applied to solve various geometric problems, namely computing the convex hull of a simple polygon, a triangulation of a monotone polygon, the shortest path between two points inside a monotone polygon, 1-dimensional pyramid approximation of a 1-dimensional vector, and the visibility profile of a point inside a simple polygon. Our approach exceeds or matches the best-known results for these problems in constant-workspace models (when they exist), and gives the first trade-off between the size of the workspace and running time.
