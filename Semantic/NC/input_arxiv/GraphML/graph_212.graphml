      <data key="title">secmace scalable and robust identity and credential management infrastructure in vehicular communication systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Several years of academic and industrial research efforts have converged to a common understanding on fundamental security building blocks for the upcoming Vehicular Communication (VC) systems. There is a growing consensus towards deploying a special-purpose identity and credential management infrastructure, i.e., a Vehicular Public-Key Infrastructure (VPKI), enabling pseudonymous authentication, with standardization efforts towards that direction. In spite of the progress made by standardization bodies (IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI) and harmonization efforts (Car2Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC)), significant questions remain unanswered towards deploying a VPKI. Deep understanding of the VPKI, a central building block of secure and privacy-preserving VC systems, is still lacking. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap. We present SECMACE, a VPKI system, which is compatible with the IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI standards specifications. We provide a detailed description of our state-of-the-art VPKI that improves upon existing proposals in terms of security and privacy protection, and efficiency. SECMACE facilitates multi-domain operations in the VC systems and enhances user privacy, notably preventing linking pseudonyms based on timing information and offering increased protection even against honest-but-curious VPKI entities. We propose multiple policies for the vehicle-VPKI interactions, based on which and two large-scale mobility trace datasets, we evaluate the full-blown implementation of SECMACE. With very little attention on the VPKI performance thus far, our results reveal that modest computing resources can support a large area of vehicles with very low delays and the most promising policy in terms of privacy protection can be supported with moderate overhead.</data>

      <data key="title">on kljn based secure key distribution in vehicular communication networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">In a former paper [Fluct. Noise Lett. 13 (2014) 1450020] we introduced a vehicular communication system with unconditionally secure key exchange based on the Kirchhoff-Law–Johnson-Noise (KLJN) key distribution scheme. In this paper, we address the secure KLJN key donation to vehicles. This KLJN key donation solution is performed lane-by-lane by using roadside key provider equipment embedded in the pavement. A method to compute the lifetime of the KLJN key is also given. This key lifetime depends on the car density and gives an upper limit of the lifetime of the KLJN key for vehicular communication networks.</data>

      <data key="title">an electric vehicle charging management scheme based on publish subscribe communication framework</data>
      <data key="abstract">Motivated by alleviating CO2 pollution, electric vehicle (EV)-based applications have recently received wide interests from both commercial and research communities by using electric energy instead of traditional fuel energy. Although EVs are inherently with limited traveling distance, such limitation could be overcome by deploying public charging stations (CSs) to recharge EVs' battery during their journeys. In this paper we propose a novel communication framework for on-the-move EV charging scenario, based on the Publish/Subscribe (P/S) mechanism for disseminating necessary CS information to EVs, in order for them to make optimized decisions on where to charge. A core part of our communication framework is the utilization of roadside units (RSUs) to bridge the information flow from CSs to EVs, which has been regarded as a type of cost-efficient communication infrastructure. Under this design, we introduce two complementary communication modes of signal protocols, namely, push and pull modes, in order to enable the required information dissemination operation. Both analysis and simulation show the advantage of the pull mode, in which the information is cached at RSUs to support asynchronous communication. We further propose a remote reservation service based on the pull mode such that the CS-selection decision making can utilize the knowledge of EVs' charging reservation, as published from EVs through RSUs to CSs. Results show that both performances at CS and EV sides are further improved based on using this anticipated information.</data>

      <data key="title">survey on misbehavior detection in cooperative intelligent transportation systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Cooperative intelligent transportation systems (cITS) are a promising technology to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like public key infrastructure (PKI)-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.</data>

      <data key="title">secure vehicular communication systems design and architecture</data>
      <data key="abstract">Significant developments have taken place over the past few years in the area of vehicular communication systems. Now, it is well understood in the community that security and protection of private user information are a prerequisite for the deployment of the technology. This is so precisely because the benefits of VC systems, with the mission to enhance transportation safety and efficiency, are at stake. Without the integration of strong and practical security and privacy enhancing mechanisms, VC systems can be disrupted or disabled, even by relatively unsophisticated attackers. We address this problem within the SeVeCom project, having developed a security architecture that provides a comprehensive and practical solution. We present our results in a set of two articles in this issue. In this first one, we analyze threats and types of adversaries, identify security and privacy requirements, and present a spectrum of mechanisms to secure VC systems. We provide a solution that can be quickly adopted and deployed. In the second article we present our progress toward the implementation of our architecture and results on the performance of the secure VC system, along with a discussion of upcoming research challenges and our related current results.</data>

      <data key="title">robust deep reinforcement learning for security and safety in autonomous vehicle systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">To operate effectively in tomorrow's smart cities, autonomous vehicles (AVs) must rely on intra-vehicle sensors such as camera and radar as well as inter-vehicle communication. Such dependence on sensors and communication links exposes AVs to cyber-physical (CP) attacks by adversaries that seek to take control of the AVs by manipulating their data. Thus, to ensure safe and optimal AV dynamics control, the data processing functions at AVs must be robust to such CP attacks. To this end, in this paper, the state estimation process for monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions. Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, the outcome of the players' past interactions are fed to long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks. Each player's LSTM block learns the expected spacing deviation resulting from its own action and feeds it to its RL algorithm. Then, the the attacker's RL algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the AV's RL algorithm tries to find the optimal action that minimizes such deviation.</data>

      <data key="title">impact of vehicular communications security on transportation safety</data>
      <data key="abstract">Transportation safety, one of the main driving forces of the development of vehicular communication (VC) systems, relies on high-rate safety messaging (beaconing). At the same time, there is consensus among authorities, industry, and academia on the need to secure VC systems. With specific proposals in the literature, a critical question must be answered: can secure VC systems be practical and satisfy the requirements of safety applications, in spite of the significant communication and processing overhead and other restrictions security and privacy-enhancing mechanisms impose? To answer this question, we investigate in this paper the following three dimensions for secure and privacy-enhancing VC schemes: the reliability of communication, the processing overhead at each node, and the impact on a safety application. The results indicate that with the appropriate system design, including sufficiently high processing power, applications enabled by secure VC can be in practice as effective as those enabled by unsecured VC.</data>

      <data key="title">the case for dynamic key distribution for pki based vanets</data>
      <data key="abstract">Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are becoming a reality where secure communication is a prerequisite. Public key infrastructure (PKI) can be used to secure VANETs where an onboard tamper proof device (TPD) stores a number of encryption keys which are renewed upon visiting a certificate authority (CA). We previously proposed a dynamic key distribution protocol for PKI-based VANETs [1] to reduce the role of the TPD. A vehicle dynamically requests a key from its nearest road side unit. This request is propagated through network infrastructure to reach a CA cloud and a key is securely returned. A proposed key revocation mechanism reduced the number of messages needed for revocation through Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution. In this paper, performance evaluation and security of the proposed dynamic key distribution is investigated analytically and through network simulation. Furthermore, extensive analysis is performed to demonstrate how the proposed protocol can dynamically support efficient and cost-reduced key distribution. Analysis and performance evaluation results clearly make the case for dynamic key distribution for PKI-based VANETS.</data>

      <data key="abstract">As location-based techniques and applications become ubiquitous in emerging wireless networks, the verification of location information will become of growing importance. This has led in recent years to an explosion of activity related to location verification techniques in wireless networks, with a specific focus on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) being evident. Such focus is largely due to the mission-critical nature of vehicle location verification within the ITS scenario. In this work we review recent research in wireless location verification related to the vehicular network scenario. We particularly focus on location verification systems that rely on formal mathematical classification frameworks, showing how many systems are either partially or fully encompassed by such frameworks.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Vehicular Communications (VC) are reaching a near deployment phase and will play an important role in improving road safety, driving efficiency and comfort. The industry and the academia have reached a consensus for the need of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), in order to achieve security, identity management, vehicle authentication, as well as preserve vehicle privacy. Moreover, a gamut of proprietary and safety applications, such as location-based services and pay-as-you-drive systems, are going to be offered to the vehicles. The emerging applications are posing new challenges for the existing Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI) architectures to support Authentication, Authorization and Accountability (AAA), without exposing vehicle privacy. In this work we present an implementation of a VPKI that is compatible with the VC standards. We propose the use of tickets as cryptographic tokens to provide AAA and also preserve vehicle privacy against adversaries and the VPKI. Finally, we present the efficiency results of our implementation to prove its applicability.</data>

      <data key="title">cyber physical security and safety of autonomous connected vehicles optimal control meets multi armed bandit learning</data>
      <data key="abstract">Autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) rely on intra-vehicle sensors such as camera and radar as well as inter-vehicle communication to operate effectively. This reliance on cyber components exposes ACVs to cyber and physical attacks in which an adversary can manipulate sensor readings and physically take control of an ACV. In this paper, a comprehensive framework is proposed to thwart cyber and physical attacks on ACV networks. First, an optimal safe controller for ACVs is derived to maximize the street traffic flow while minimizing the risk of accidents by optimizing ACV speed and inter-ACV spacing. It is proven that the proposed controller is robust to physical attacks which aim at making ACV systems instable. To improve the cyber-physical security of ACV systems, next, data injection attack (DIA) detection approaches are proposed to address cyber attacks on sensors and their physical impact on the ACV system. To comprehensively design the DIA detection approaches, ACV sensors are characterized in two subsets based on the availability of a-priori information about their data. For sensors having a prior information, a DIA detection approach is proposed and an optimal threshold level is derived for the difference between the actual and estimated values of sensors data which enables ACV to stay robust against cyber attacks. For sensors having no prior information, a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm is proposed to enable ACV to securely control its motion. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal safe controller outperforms current state of the art controllers by maximizing the robustness of ACVs to physical attacks. The results also show that the proposed DIA detection approaches, compared to Kalman filtering, can improve the security of ACV sensors against cyber attacks and ultimately improve the physical robustness of an ACV system.</data>

      <data key="title">secure neighbor discovery in wireless networks formal investigation of possibility</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wireless communication enables a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from commodity to tactical systems. Neighbor discovery (ND), that is, determining which devices are within direct radio communication, is a building block of network protocols and applications, and its vulnerability can severely compromise their functionalities. A number of proposals to secure ND have been published, but none have analyzed the problem formally. In this paper, we contribute such an analysis: We build a formal model capturing salient characteristics of wireless systems, most notably obstacles and interference, and we provide a specification of a basic variant of the ND problem. Then, we derive an impossibility result for a general class of protocols we term "time-based protocols," to which many of the schemes in the literature belong. We also identify the conditions under which the impossibility result is lifted. Moreover, we explore a second class of protocols we term "time- and location-based protocols," and prove they can secure ND.</data>

      <data key="title">a secure and authenticated key management protocol sa kmp for vehicular networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Public key infrastructure (PKI) is the most widely used security mechanism for securing communications over the network. However, there are known performance issues, making it unsuitable for use in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a secure and authenticated key management protocol (SA-KMP) to overcome the shortcomings of the PKI. The SA-KMP scheme distributes repository containing the bindings of the en-tity's identity and its corresponding public key to each vehicle and road side unit. By doing so, certificate exchanges and certificate revocation lists are eliminated. Furthermore, the SA-KMP scheme uses symmetric keys derived based on a 3-D-matrix-based key agreement scheme to reduce the high computational costs of using asymmetric cryptography. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SA-KMP through performance evaluations in terms of transmission and storage overhead, network latency, and key generation time. Analytical results show that the SA-KMP is more scalable and outperforms the certificate-based PKI. Simulation results indicate that the key generation time of the SA-KMP scheme is less than that of the existing Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman and Diffie–Hellman protocols. In addition, we use Proverif to prove that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against an active attacker under the Dolev and Yao model and further show that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against denial of service, collusion attacks, and a wide range of other malicious attacks.</data>

This is achieved due to the possibility to efficiently support message exchange in-between vehicles by multicasting information to several vehicles in parallel (point-to-multipoint transmission) employing an Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS). We investigate two metrics to gauge the performance of MBMS/MBSFN transmissions in comparison with standard unicast transmissions for vehicular communications: latency of packet delivery and overhead caused by vehicular traffic, i.e., network utilization.

      <data key="abstract">Many significant functionalities of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) require that nodes have knowledge of the positions of other vehicles, and notably of those within communication range. However, adversarial nodes could provide false position information or disrupt the acquisition of such information. Thus, in VANETs, the discovery of neighbor positions should be performed in a secure manner. In spite of a multitude of security protocols in the literature, there is no secure discovery protocol for neighbors positions. We address this problem in our paper: we design a distributed protocol that relies solely on information exchange among one-hop neighbors, we analyze its security properties in presence of one or multiple (independent or colluding) adversaries, and we evaluate its performance in a VANET environment using realistic mobility traces. We show that our protocol can be highly effective in detecting falsified position information, while maintaining a low rate of false positive detections.</data>

There is a growing consensus towards deploying a Vehicular Public-Key Infrastructure (VPKI) enables pseudonymous authentication, with standardization efforts in that direction.

Existing proposals for instantiating the VPKI either need additional detailed specifications or enhanced security and privacy features. Equally important, there is limited experimental work that establishes the VPKI efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we are concerned with exactly these issues. We leverage the common VPKI approach and contribute an enhanced system with precisely defined, novel features that improve its resilience and the user privacy protection. In particular, we depart from the common assumption that the VPKI entities are fully trusted and we improve user privacy in the face of an honest-but-curious security infrastructure. Moreover, we fully implement our VPKI, in a standard-compliant manner, and we perform an extensive evaluation. Along with stronger protection and richer functionality, our system achieves very significant performance improvement over prior systems — contributing the most advanced VPKI towards deployment.</data>
