      <data key="title">abusing the tutte matrix an algebraic instance compression for the k set cycle problem</data>
      <data key="abstract">We give an algebraic, determinant-based algorithm for the K-Cycle problem, i.e., the problem of finding a cycle through a set of specified elements. Our approach gives a simple FPT algorithm for the problem, matching the $O^*(2^{|K|})$ running time of the algorithm of Bj\"orklund et al. (SODA, 2012). Furthermore, our approach is open for treatment by classical algebraic tools (e.g., Gaussian elimination), and we show that it leads to a polynomial compression of the problem, i.e., a polynomial-time reduction of the $K$-Cycle problem into an algebraic problem with coding size $O(|K|^3)$. This is surprising, as several related problems (e.g., k-Cycle and the Disjoint Paths problem) are known not to admit such a reduction unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Furthermore, despite the result, we are not aware of any witness for the K-Cycle problem of size polynomial in $|K|+\log n$, which seems (for now) to separate the notions of polynomial compression and polynomial kernelization (as a polynomial kernelization for a problem in NP necessarily implies a small witness).</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present randomized algorithms for some well-studied, hard combinatorial problems: the k-path problem, the p-packing of q-sets problem, and the q-dimensional p-matching problem. Our algorithms solve these problems with high probability in time exponential only in the parameter (k, p, q) and using polynomial space; the constant bases of the exponentials are significantly smaller than in previous works. For example, for the k-path problem the improvement is from 2 to 1.66. We also show how to detect if a d-regular graph admits an edge coloring with $d$ colors in time within a polynomial factor of O(2^{(d-1)n/2}). #R##N#Our techniques build upon and generalize some recently published ideas by I.

      <data key="title">approximating multilinear monomial coefficients and maximum multilinear monomials in multivariate polynomials</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper is our third step towards developing a theory of testing monomials in multivariate polynomials and concentrates on two problems: (1) How to compute the coefficients of multilinear monomials; and (2) how to find a maximum multilinear monomial when the input is a ΠΣΠ polynomial. We first prove that the first problem is #P-hard and then devise a O*(3n s(n)) upper bound for this problem for any polynomial represented by an arithmetic circuit of size s(n). Later, this upper bound is improved to O*(2n) for ΠΣΠ polynomials. We then design fully polynomial-time randomized approximation schemes for this problem for ΠΣ polynomials. On the negative side, we prove that, even for ΠΣΠ polynomials with terms of degree ≤ 2, the first problem cannot be approximated at all for any approximation factor ≥ 1, nor "weakly approximated" in a much relaxed setting, unless P=NP. For the second problem, we first give a polynomial time λ-approximation algorithm for ΠΣΠ polynomials with terms of degrees no more a constant λ ≥ 2. On the inapproximability side, we give a n(1-e)/2 lower bound, for any e &gt; 0, on the approximation factor for ΠΣΠ polynomials. When the degrees of the terms in these polynomials are constrained as le; 2, we prove a 1.0476 lower bound, assuming P ≠ NP; and a higher 1.0604 lower bound, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.</data>

      <data key="title">the set cover conjecture and subgraph isomorphism with a tree pattern</data>
      <data key="abstract">In the Set Cover problem, the input is a ground set of $n$ elements and a collection of $m$ sets, and the goal is to find the smallest sub-collection of sets whose union is the entire ground set. The fastest algorithm known runs in time $O(mn2^n)$ [Fomin et al., WG 2004], and the Set Cover Conjecture (SeCoCo) [Cygan et al., TALG 2016] asserts that for every fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, no algorithm can solve Set Cover in time $2^{(1-\varepsilon)n}poly(m)$, even if set sizes are bounded by $\Delta=\Delta(\varepsilon)$. We show strong connections between this problem and kTree, a special case of Subgraph Isomorphism where the input is an $n$-node graph $G$ and a $k$-node tree $T$, and the goal is to determine whether $G$ has a subgraph isomorphic to $T$. #R##N#First, we propose a weaker conjecture Log-SeCoCo, that allows input sets of size $\Delta=O(1/\varepsilon \cdot\log n)$, and show that an algorithm breaking Log-SeCoCo would imply a faster algorithm than the currently known $2^n poly(n)$-time algorithm [Koutis and Williams, TALG 2016] for Directed nTree, which is kTree with $k=n$ and arbitrary directions to the edges of $G$ and $T$. This would also improve the running time for Directed Hamiltonicity, for which no algorithm significantly faster than $2^n poly(n)$ is known despite extensive research. #R##N#Second, we prove that if Set Cover cannot be solved significantly faster than $2^npoly(m)$ (an assumption even weaker than Log-SeCoCo), then kTree cannot be computed significantly faster than $2^kpoly(n)$, the running time of the Koutis and Williams' algorithm. Applying the same techniques to the p-Partial Cover problem, a parameterized version of Set Cover that requires covering at least $p$ elements, we obtain a new algorithm with running time $(2+\varepsilon)^p (m+n)^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ for arbitrary $\varepsilon&gt;0$, which improves previous work and is nearly optimal assuming say Log-SeCoCo.</data>

      <data key="title">parameterized approximation algorithms for packing problems</data>
      <data key="abstract">In the past decade, many parameterized algorithms were developed for packing problems. Our goal is to obtain tradeoffs that improve the running times of these algorithms at the cost of computing approximate solutions. Consider a packing problem for which there is no known algorithm with approximation ratio $\alpha$, and a parameter $k$. If the value of an optimal solution is at least $k$, we seek a solution of value at least $\alpha k$; otherwise, we seek an arbitrary solution. Clearly, if the best known parameterized algorithm that finds a solution of value $t$ runs in time $O^*(f(t))$ for some function $f$, we are interested in running times better than $O^*(f(\alpha k))$. We present tradeoffs between running times and approximation ratios for the $P_2$-Packing, $3$-Set $k$-Packing and $3$-Dimensional $k$-Matching problems. Our tradeoffs are based on combinations of several known results, as well as a computation of "approximate lopsided universal sets."</data>

      <data key="title">towards randomized testing of q monomials in multivariate polynomials</data>
      <data key="abstract">Given any fixed integer $q\ge 2$, a $q$-monomial is of the format $\displaystyle x^{s_1}_{i_1}x^{s_2}_{i_2}...x_{i_t}^{s_t}$ such that $1\le s_j \le q-1$, $1\le j \le t$. $q$-monomials are natural generalizations of multilinear monomials. Recent research on testing multilinear monomials and $q$-monomails for prime $q$ in multivariate polynomials relies on the property that $Z_q$ is a field when $q\ge 2 $ is prime. When $q&gt;2$ is not prime, it remains open whether the problem of testing $q$-monomials can be solved in some compatible complexity. In this paper, we present a randomized $O^*(7.15^k)$ algorithm for testing $q$-monomials of degree $k$ that are found in a multivariate polynomial that is represented by a tree-like circuit with a polynomial size, thus giving a positive, affirming answer to the above question. Our algorithm works regardless of the primality of $q$ and improves upon the time complexity of the previously known algorithm for testing $q$-monomials for prime $q&gt;7$.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Assume that a group of people is going to an excursion and our task is to seat them into buses with several constraints each saying that a pair of people does not want to see each other in the same bus. This is a well-known coloring problem and it can be solved in $O^*(2^n)$ time by the inclusion-exclusion principle as shown by Bj\"{o}rklund, Husfeldt, and Koivisto in 2009.Another approach to solve this problem in $O^*(2^n)$ time is to use the fast Fourier transform. A graph is $k$-colorable if and only if the $k$-th power of a polynomial containing a monomial $\prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{[i \in I]}$ for each independent set $I \subseteq [n]$ of the graph, contains the monomial $x_1x_2... x_n$. #R##N#Assume now that we have additional constraints: the group of people contains several infants and these infants should be accompanied by their relatives in a bus. We show that if the number of infants is linear then the problem can be solved in $O^*((2-\varepsilon)^n)$ time.

      <data key="title">on space efficiency of algorithms working on structural decompositions of graphs</data>
      <data key="abstract">Dynamic programming on path and tree decompositions of graphs is a technique that is ubiquitous in the field of parameterized and exponential-time algorithms. However, one of its drawbacks is that the space usage is exponential in the decomposition's width. Following the work of Allender et al. [Theory of Computing, '14], we investigate whether this space complexity explosion is unavoidable. Using the idea of reparameterization of Cai and Juedes [J. Comput. Syst. Sci., '03], we prove that the question is closely related to a conjecture that the Longest Common Subsequence problem parameterized by the number of input strings does not admit an algorithm that simultaneously uses XP time and FPT space. Moreover, we complete the complexity landscape sketched for pathwidth and treewidth by Allender et al. by considering the parameter tree-depth. We prove that computations on tree-depth decompositions correspond to a model of non-deterministic machines that work in polynomial time and logarithmic space, with access to an auxiliary stack of maximum height equal to the decomposition's depth. Together with the results of Allender et al., this describes a hierarchy of complexity classes for polynomial-time non-deterministic machines with different restrictions on the access to working space, which mirrors the classic relations between treewidth, pathwidth, and tree-depth.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We present a Monte Carlo algorithm for Hamiltonicity detection in an $n$-vertex undirected graph running in $O^*(1.657^{n})$ time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first superpolynomial improvement on the worst case runtime for the problem since the $O^*(2^n)$ bound established for TSP almost fifty years ago (Bellman 1962, Held and Karp 1962). It answers in part the first open problem in Woeginger's 2003 survey on exact algorithms for NP-hard problems. #R##N#For bipartite graphs, we improve the bound to $O^*(1.414^{n})$ time. Both the bipartite and the general algorithm can be implemented to use space polynomial in $n$. #R##N#We combine several recently resurrected ideas to get the results.

We introduce the Labeled Cycle Cover Sum in which we are set to count weighted arc labeled cycle covers over a finite field of characteristic two. We reduce Hamiltonicity to Labeled Cycle Cover Sum and apply the determinant summation technique for Exact Set Covers (Bj\"orklund STACS 2010) to evaluate it.</data>

      <data key="title">going far from degeneracy</data>
      <data key="abstract">An undirected graph G is d-degenerate if every subgraph of G has a vertex of degree at most d. By the classical theorem of Erdős and Gallai from 1959, every graph of degeneracy d&gt;1 contains a cycle of length at least d+1. The proof of Erdős and Gallai is constructive and can be turned into a polynomial time algorithm constructing a cycle of length at least d+1. But can we decide in polynomial time whether a graph contains a cycle of length at least d+2? An easy reduction from Hamiltonian Cycle provides a negative answer to this question: deciding whether a graph has a cycle of length at least d+2 is NP-complete. Surprisingly, the complexity of the problem changes drastically when the input graph is 2-connected. In this case we prove that deciding whether G contains a cycle of length at least d+k can be done in time 2^{O(k)}|V(G)|^{O(1)}. In other words, deciding whether a 2-connected n-vertex G contains a cycle of length at least d+log n can be done in polynomial time. #R##N#Similar algorithmic results hold for long paths in graphs. We observe that deciding whether a graph has a path of length at least d+1 is NP-complete. However, we prove that if graph G is connected, then deciding whether G contains a path of length at least d+k can be done in time 2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}. We complement these results by showing that the choice of degeneracy as the `above guarantee parameterization' is optimal in the following sense: For any \epsilon&gt;0 it is NP-complete to decide whether a connected (2-connected) graph of degeneracy d has a path (cycle) of length at least (1+\epsilon)d.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We study the design of fixed-parameter algorithms for problems already known to be solvable in polynomial time. The main motivation is to get more efficient algorithms for problems with unattractive polynomial running times. Here, we focus on a fundamental graph problem: Longest Path, that is, given an undirected graph, find a maximum-length path in $G$. Longest Path is NP-hard in general but known to be solvable in $O(n^{4})$ time on $n$-vertex interval graphs. We show how to solve Longest Path on Interval Graphs, parameterized by vertex deletion number $k$ to proper interval graphs, in $O(k^{9}n)$ time. Notably, Longest Path is trivially solvable in linear time on proper interval graphs, and the parameter value $k$ can be approximated up to a factor of 4 in linear time. From a more general perspective, we believe that using parameterized complexity analysis may enable a refined understanding of efficiency aspects for polynomial-time solvable problems similarly to what classical parameterized complexity analysis does for NP-hard problems.</data>

      <data key="title">reducing randomness via irrational numbers</data>
      <data key="abstract">We propose a general methodology for testing whether a given polynomial with integer coefficients is identically zero. The methodology evaluates the polynomial at efficiently computable approximations of suitable irrational points. In contrast to the classical technique of DeMillo, Lipton, Schwartz, and Zippel, this methodology can decrease the error probability by increasing the precision of the approximations instead of using more random bits. Consequently, randomized algorithms that use the classical technique can generally be improved using the new methodology. To demonstrate the methodology, we discuss two nontrivial applications. The first is to decide whether a graph has a perfect matching in parallel. Our new NC algorithm uses fewer random bits while doing less work than the previously best NC algorithm by Chari, Rohatgi, and Srinivasan. The second application is to test the equality of two multisets of integers. Our new algorithm improves upon the previously best algorithms by Blum and Kannan and can speed up their checking algorithm for sorting programs on a large range of inputs.</data>

For the remaining two problems, our algorithms significantly outperform the previously best known parameterized algorithms that run in time $2^{O(k^{0.75}\log{k})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$. Our algorithms are based on a new kind of tree decompositions of unit disk graphs where the separators can have size up to $k^{O(1)}$ and there exists a solution that crosses every separator at most $O(\sqrt{k})$ times.

      <data key="abstract">Many combinatorial problems involve determining whether a universe of $n$ elements contains a witness consisting of $k$ elements which have some specified property. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the decision and enumeration versions of such problems: efficient methods are known for transforming a decision algorithm into a search procedure that finds a single witness, but even finding a second witness is not so straightforward in general. We show that, if the decision version of the problem can be solved in time $f(k) \cdot poly(n)$, there is a randomised algorithm which enumerates all witnesses in time $e^{k + o(k)} \cdot f(k) \cdot poly(n) \cdot N$, where $N$ is the total number of witnesses. If the decision version of the problem is solved by a randomised algorithm which may return false negatives, then the same method allows us to output a list of witnesses in which any given witness will be included with high probability. The enumeration algorithm also gives rise to an efficient algorithm to count the total number of witnesses when this number is small.</data>

For dense graphs, this bound becomes $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$. This is a somewhat unique situation, since most of the studied graph problems admit algorithms running in time $2^{O(n\log n)}$. It is a notorious open problem to either show an algorithm for edge coloring running in time $2^{o(n^2)}$ or to refute it, assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) or other well established assumption. #R##N#We notice that the same question can be asked for list edge coloring, a well-studied generalization of edge coloring where every edge comes with a set (often called a list) of allowed colors. Our main result states that list edge coloring for simple graphs does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{o(n^2)}$, unless ETH fails. Interestingly, the algorithm for edge coloring running in time $2^m n^{O(1)}$ generalizes to the list version without any asymptotic slow-down. Thus, our lower bound is essentially tight. This also means that in order to design an algorithm running in time $2^{o(n^2)}$ for edge coloring, one has to exploit its special features compared to the list version.</data>
