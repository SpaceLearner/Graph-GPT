      <data key="title">compressed sensing of analog signals in shift invariant spaces</data>
      <data key="abstract">A traditional assumption underlying most data converters is that the signal should be sampled at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency. This statement is based on a worst-case scenario in which the signal occupies the entire available bandwidth. In practice, many signals are sparse so that only part of the bandwidth is used. In this paper, we develop methods for low-rate sampling of continuous-time sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces, generated by m kernels with period T . We model sparsity by treating the case in which only k out of the m generators are active, however, we do not know which k are chosen. We show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than m/T, which is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity. Our approach combines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed block diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite counterpart. Using these two components we formulate our problem within the framework of finite compressed sensing (CS) and then rely on algorithms developed in that context. The distinguishing feature of our results is that in contrast to standard CS, which treats finite-length vectors, we consider sampling of analog signals for which no underlying finite-dimensional model exists. The proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature on CS to the analog domain.</data>

      <data key="abstract">Highly coherent sensing matrices arise in discretization of continuum imaging problems such as radar and medical imaging when the grid spacing is below the Rayleigh threshold. #R##N#Algorithms based on techniques of band exclusion (BE) and local optimization (LO) are proposed to deal with such coherent sensing matrices. These techniques are embedded in the existing compressed sensing algorithms such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Subspace Pursuit (SP), Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), Basis Pursuit (BP) and Lasso, and result in the modified algorithms BLOOMP, BLOSP, BLOIHT, BP-BLOT and Lasso-BLOT, respectively. #R##N#Under appropriate conditions, it is proved that BLOOMP can reconstruct sparse, widely separated objects up to one Rayleigh length in the Bottleneck distance {\em independent} of the grid spacing. One of the most distinguishing attributes of BLOOMP is its capability of dealing with large dynamic ranges. #R##N#The BLO-based algorithms are systematically tested with respect to four performance metrics: dynamic range, noise stability, sparsity and resolution. With respect to dynamic range and noise stability, BLOOMP is the best performer. With respect to sparsity, BLOOMP is the best performer for high dynamic range while for dynamic range near unity BP-BLOT and Lasso-BLOT with the optimized regularization parameter have the best performance. In the noiseless case, BP-BLOT has the highest resolving power up to certain dynamic range. #R##N#The algorithms BLOSP and BLOIHT are good alternatives to #R##N#BLOOMP and BP/Lasso-BLOT: they are faster than both BLOOMP and BP/Lasso-BLOT and shares, to a lesser degree, BLOOMP's amazing attribute with respect to dynamic range. #R##N#Detailed comparisons with existing algorithms such as Spectral Iterative Hard Thresholding (SIHT) and the frame-adapted BP are given.</data>

      <data key="title">compressive phase only filtering at extreme compression rates</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   We introduce an efficient method for the reconstruction of the correlation between a compressively measured image and a phase-only filter. The proposed method is based on two properties of phase-only filtering: such filtering is a unitary circulant transform, and the correlation plane it produces is usually sparse. Thanks to these properties, phase-only filters are perfectly compatible with the framework of compressive sensing. Moreover, the lasso-based recovery algorithm is very fast when phase-only filtering is used as the compression matrix. The proposed method can be seen as a generalization of the correlation-based pattern recognition technique, which is hereby applied directly to non-adaptively acquired compressed data. At the time of measurement, any prior knowledge of the target object for which the data will be scanned is not required. We show that images measured at extremely high compression rates may still contain sufficient information for target classification and localization, even if the compression rate is high enough, that visual recognition of the target in the reconstructed image is no longer possible. The method has been applied by us to highly undersampled measurements obtained from a single-pixel camera, with sampling based on randomly chosen Walsh–Hadamard patterns.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We consider the general problem of matching a subspace to a signal in R^N that has been observed indirectly (compressed) through a random projection. We are interested in the case where the collection of K-dimensional subspaces is continuously parameterized, i.e. naturally indexed by an interval from the real line, or more generally a region of R^D. Our main results show that if the dimension of the random projection is on the order of K times a geometrical constant that describes the complexity of the collection, then the match obtained from the compressed observation is nearly as good as one obtained from a full observation of the signal. We give multiple concrete examples of collections of subspaces for which this geometrical constant can be estimated, and discuss the relevance of the results to the general problems of template matching and source localization.</data>

      <data key="title">beyond nyquist efficient sampling of sparse bandlimited signals</data>
      <data key="abstract">Wideband analog signals push contemporary analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) systems to their performance limits. In many applications, however, sampling at the Nyquist rate is inefficient because the signals of interest contain only a small number of significant frequencies relative to the band limit, although the locations of the frequencies may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse signal, other sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type of data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is constructed from robust, readily available components. Let K denote the total number of frequencies in the signal, and let W denote its band limit in hertz. Simulations suggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per second to stably reconstruct the signal. This sampling rate is exponentially lower than the Nyquist rate of W hertz. In contrast to Nyquist sampling, one must use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the signal from the samples taken by the random demodulator. This paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the system's performance that supports the empirical observations.</data>

      <data key="title">compressive sensing of analog signals using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences</data>
      <data key="abstract">Compressive sensing (CS) has recently emerged as a framework for efficiently capturing signals that are sparse or compressible in an appropriate basis. While often motivated as an alternative to Nyquist-rate sampling, there remains a gap between the discrete, finite-dimensional CS framework and the problem of acquiring a continuous-time signal. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploiting the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's), a collection of functions that trace back to the seminal work by Slepian, Landau, and Pollack on the effects of time-limiting and bandlimiting operations. DPSS's form a highly efficient basis for sampled bandlimited functions; by modulating and merging DPSS bases, we obtain a dictionary that offers high-quality sparse approximations for most sampled multiband signals. This multiband modulated DPSS dictionary can be readily incorporated into the CS framework. We provide theoretical guarantees and practical insight into the use of this dictionary for recovery of sampled multiband signals from compressive measurements.</data>

      <data key="title">an efficient method for robust projection matrix design</data>
      <data key="abstract">Our objective is to efficiently design a robust projection matrix $\Phi$ for the Compressive Sensing (CS) systems when applied to the signals that are not exactly sparse. The optimal projection matrix is obtained by mainly minimizing the average coherence of the equivalent dictionary. In order to drop the requirement of the sparse representation error (SRE) for a set of training data as in [15] [16], we introduce a novel penalty function independent of a particular SRE matrix. Without requiring of training data, we can efficiently design the robust projection matrix and apply it for most of CS systems, like a CS system for image processing with a conventional wavelet dictionary in which the SRE matrix is generally not available. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate with natural images that under similar compression rate, a CS system with a learned dictionary in high dimensions outperforms the one in low dimensions in terms of reconstruction accuracy. This together with the fact that our proposed method can efficiently work in high dimension suggests that a CS system can be potentially implemented beyond the small patches in sparsity-based image processing.</data>

      <data key="title">approximating sampled sinusoids and multiband signals using multiband modulated dpss dictionaries</data>
      <data key="abstract">Many signal processing problems--such as analysis, compression, denoising, and reconstruction--can be facilitated by expressing the signal as a linear combination of atoms from a well-chosen dictionary. In this paper, we study possible dictionaries for representing the discrete vector one obtains when collecting a finite set of uniform samples from a multiband analog signal. By analyzing the spectrum of combined time- and multiband-limiting operations in the discrete-time domain, we conclude that the information level of the sampled multiband vectors is essentially equal to the time-frequency area. For representing these vectors, we consider a dictionary formed by concatenating a collection of modulated Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's). We study the angle between the subspaces spanned by this dictionary and an optimal dictionary, and we conclude that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary--which is simple to construct and more flexible than the optimal dictionary in practical applications--is nearly optimal for representing multiband sample vectors. We also show that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary not only provides a very high degree of approximation accuracy in an MSE sense for multiband sample vectors (using a number of atoms comparable to the information level), but also that it can provide high-quality approximations of all sampled sinusoids within the bands of interest.</data>

      <data key="title">new analysis of manifold embeddings and signal recovery from compressive measurements</data>
      <data key="abstract">Compressive Sensing (CS) exploits the surprising fact that the information contained in a sparse signal can be preserved in a small number of compressive, often random linear measurements of that signal. Strong theoretical guarantees have been established concerning the embedding of a sparse signal family under a random measurement operator and on the accuracy to which sparse signals can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Using tools from the theory of empirical processes, we improve upon previous results concerning the embedding of low-dimensional manifolds under random measurement operators. We also establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal bounds in $\ell_2$ for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation from noisy compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for sparsity-based CS, we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the probabilistic setting. Our work supports the growing evidence that manifold-based models can be used with high accuracy in compressive signal processing.</data>

      <data key="title">on collaborative compressive sensing systems the framework design and algorithm</data>
      <data key="abstract">We propose a collaborative compressive sensing (CCS) framework consisting of a bank of $K$ compressive sensing (CS) systems that share the same sensing matrix but have different sparsifying dictionaries. This CCS system is guaranteed to yield better performance than each individual CS system in a statistical sense, while with the parallel computing strategy, it requires the same time as that needed for each individual CS system to conduct compression and signal recovery. We then provide an approach to designing optimal CCS systems by utilizing a measure that involves both the sensing matrix and dictionaries and hence allows us to simultaneously optimize the sensing matrix and all the $K$ dictionaries under the same scheme. An alternating minimization-based algorithm is derived for solving the corresponding optimal design problem. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis to show that the proposed algorithm is convergent. Experiments with real images are carried out and show that the proposed CCS system significantly improves on existing CS systems in terms of the signal recovery accuracy.</data>

      <data key="title">circulant and toeplitz matrices in compressed sensing</data>
      <data key="abstract">Compressed sensing seeks to recover a sparse vector from a small number of linear and non-adaptive measurements. While most work so far focuses on Gaussian or Bernoulli random measurements we investigate the use of partial random circulant and Toeplitz matrices in connection with recovery by $\ell_1$-minization. In contrast to recent work in this direction we allow the use of an arbitrary subset of rows of a circulant and Toeplitz matrix. Our recovery result predicts that the necessary number of measurements to ensure sparse reconstruction by $\ell_1$-minimization with random partial circulant or Toeplitz matrices scales linearly in the sparsity up to a $\log$-factor in the ambient dimension. This represents a significant improvement over previous recovery results for such matrices. As a main tool for the proofs we use a new version of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality.</data>

      <data key="title">time delay estimation from low rate samples a union of subspaces approach</data>
      <data key="abstract">Time-delay estimation arises in many applications in which a multipath medium has to be identified from pulses transmitted through the channel. Previous methods for time delay recovery either operate on the analog received signal, or require sampling at the Nyquist rate of the transmitted pulse. In this paper, we develop a unified approach to time delay estimation from low-rate samples. This problem can be formulated in the broader context of sampling over an infinite union of subspaces. Although sampling over unions of subspaces has been receiving growing interest, previous results either focus on unions of finite-dimensional subspaces, or finite unions. The framework we develop here leads to perfect recovery of the multipath delays from samples of the channel output at the lowest possible rate, even in the presence of overlapping transmitted pulses, and allows for a variety of different sampling methods. The sampling rate depends only on the number of multipath components and the transmission rate, but not on the bandwidth of the probing signal. This result can be viewed as a sampling theorem over an infinite union of infinite dimensional subspaces. By properly manipulating the low-rate samples, we show that the time delays can be recovered using the well-known ESPRIT algorithm. Combining results from sampling theory with those obtained in the context of direction of arrival estimation, we develop sufficient conditions on the transmitted pulse and the sampling functions in order to ensure perfect recovery of the channel parameters at the minimal possible rate.</data>

Unlike previous work in compressed sensing, the frequencies are not assumed to lie on a grid, but can assume any values in the normalized frequency domain [0,1]. We propose an atomic norm minimization approach to exactly recover the unobserved samples. We reformulate this atomic norm minimization as an exact semidefinite program. Even with this continuous dictionary, we show that most sampling sets of size O(s log s log n) are sufficient to guarantee the exact frequency estimation with high probability, provided the frequencies are well separated. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</data>

      <data key="title">towards a mathematical theory of super resolution</data>
      <data key="abstract">This paper develops a mathematical theory of super-resolution. Broadly speaking, super-resolution is the problem of recovering the fine details of an object---the high end of its spectrum---from coarse scale information only---from samples at the low end of the spectrum. Suppose we have many point sources at unknown locations in $[0,1]$ and with unknown complex-valued amplitudes. We only observe Fourier samples of this object up until a frequency cut-off $f_c$. We show that one can super-resolve these point sources with infinite precision---i.e. recover the exact locations and amplitudes---by solving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be reformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance between sources is at least $2/f_c$. This result extends to higher dimensions and other models. In one dimension for instance, it is possible to recover a piecewise smooth function by resolving the discontinuity points with infinite precision as well. We also show that the theory and methods are robust to noise. In particular, in the discrete setting we develop some theoretical results explaining how the accuracy of the super-resolved signal is expected to degrade when both the noise level and the {\em super-resolution factor} vary.</data>

      <data key="title">matched filtering from limited frequency samples</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper, we study a simple correlation-based strategy for estimating the unknown delay and amplitude of a signal based on a small number of noisy, randomly chosen frequency-domain samples. We model the output of this “compressive matched filter” as a random process whose mean equals the scaled, shifted autocorrelation function of the template signal. Using tools from the theory of empirical processes, we prove that the expected maximum deviation of this process from its mean decreases sharply as the number of measurements increases, and we also derive a probabilistic tail bound on the maximum deviation. Putting all of this together, we bound the minimum number of measurements required to guarantee that the empirical maximum of this random process occurs sufficiently close to the true peak of its mean function. We conclude that for broad classes of signals, this compressive matched filter will successfully estimate the unknown delay (with high probability and within a prescribed tolerance) using a number of random frequency-domain samples that scales inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio and only logarithmically in the observation bandwidth and the possible range of delays.</data>

      <data key="title">compressive parameter estimation via k median clustering</data>
      <data key="abstract">Abstract   Compressive sensing (CS) has attracted significant attention in parameter estimation tasks, where parametric dictionaries (PDs) collect signal observations for a sampling of the parameter space and yield sparse representations for signals of interest when the sampling is dense. While this sampling also leads to high dictionary coherence, one can leverage structured sparsity models to prevent highly coherent dictionary elements from appearing simultaneously in the recovered signal. However, the resulting approaches depend heavily on the careful setting of the maximum allowable coherence; furthermore, their guarantees are not concerned with general parameter estimation performance. We propose the use of earth mover’s distance (EMD), as applied to a pair of true and estimated PD coefficient vectors, to measure the parameter estimation error. We formally analyze the connection between the EMD and the parameter estimation error and show that the EMD provides a better-suited metric for parameter estimation performance than the Euclidean distance. Additionally, we analyze the previously described relationship between  K -median clustering and EMD-optimal sparse approximation and leverage it to develop improved PD-based parameter estimation algorithms. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results, showing that the proposed compressive parameter estimation algorithms have performance similar to state-of-the-art algorithms while featuring simpler implementation and broader applicability.</data>

Due to the fact that any practical system can access only signals of finite duration, time-limited restrictions of Toeplitz operators are naturally of interest. To provide a unifying treatment of such systems working on different signal domains, we consider time-limited Toeplitz operators on locally compact abelian groups with the aid of the Fourier transform on these groups. In particular, we survey existing results concerning the relationship between the spectrum of a time-limited Toeplitz operator and the spectrum of the corresponding non-time-limited Toeplitz operator. We also develop new results specifically concerning the eigenvalues of time-frequency limiting operators on locally compact abelian groups. Applications of our unifying treatment are discussed in relation to channel capacity and in relation to representation and approximation of signals.</data>

      <data key="abstract">In the theory of compressed sensing, restricted isometry analysis has become a standard tool for studying how efficiently a measurement matrix acquires information about sparse and compressible signals. Many recovery algorithms are known to succeed when the restricted isometry constants of the sampling matrix are small. Many potential applications of compressed sensing involve a data-acquisition process that proceeds by convolution with a random pulse followed by (nonrandom) subsampling. At present, the theoretical analysis of this measurement technique is lacking. This paper demonstrates that the $s$th order restricted isometry constant is small when the number $m$ of samples satisfies $m \gtrsim (s \log n)^{3/2}$, where $n$ is the length of the pulse. This bound improves on previous estimates, which exhibit quadratic scaling.</data>
