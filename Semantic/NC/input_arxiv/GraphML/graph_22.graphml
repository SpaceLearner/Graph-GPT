      <data key="title">analyzing social interaction networks from twitter for planned special events</data>
      <data key="abstract">The complex topology of real networks allows its actors to change their functional behavior. Network models provide better understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms being accountable for the growth of such networks by capturing the dynamics in the ways network agents interact and change their behavior. Considerable amount of research efforts is required for developing novel network modeling techniques to understand the structural properties such networks, reproducing similar properties based on empirical evidence, and designing such networks efficiently. First, we demonstrate how to construct social interaction networks using social media data and then present the key findings obtained from the network analytics. We analyze the characteristics and growth of such interaction networks, examine the network properties and derive important insights based on the theories of network science literature. We also discuss the application of such networks as a useful tool to effectively disseminate targeted information during planned special events. We observed that the degree-distributions of such networks follow power-law that is indicative of the existence of fewer nodes in the network with higher levels of interactions, and many other nodes with less interactions. While the network elements and average user degree grow linearly each day, densities of such networks tend to become zero. Largest connected components exhibit higher connectivity (density) when compared with the whole graph. Network radius and diameter become stable over time evidencing the small-world property. We also observe increased transitivity and higher stability of the power-law exponents as the networks grow. Data is specific to the Purdue University community and two large events, namely Purdue Day of Giving and Senator Bernie Sanders' visit to Purdue University as part of Indiana Primary Election 2016.</data>

      <data key="title">a game theoretic model motivated by the darpa network challenge</data>
      <data key="abstract">In this paper we propose a game-theoretic model to analyze events similar to the 2009 DARPA Network Challenge, which was organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for exploring the roles that the Internet and social networks play in incentivizing wide-area collaborations. The challenge was to form a group that would be the first to find the locations of ten moored weather balloons across the United States. We consider a model in which N people (who can form groups) are located in some topology with a fixed coverage volume around each person’s geographical location. We consider various topologies where the players can be located such as the Euclidean d-dimension space and the vertices of a graph. A balloon is placed in the space and a group wins if it is the first one to report the location of the balloon. A larger team has a higher probability of finding the balloon, but we assume that the prize money is divided equally among the team members. Hence there is a competing tension to keep teams as small as possible. Risk aversion is the reluctance of a person to accept a bargain with an uncertain payoff rather than another bargain with a more certain, but possibly lower, expected payoff. In our model we consider the isoelastic utility function derived from the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion. The main aim is to analyze the structures of the groups in Nash equilibria for our model. For the d-dimensional Euclidean space (d 1) and the class of bounded degree regular graphs we show that in any Nash Equilibrium the richest group (having maximum expected utility per person) covers a constant fraction of the total volume. The objective of events like the DARPA Network Challenge is to mobilize a large number of people quickly so that they can cover a big fraction of the total area. Our results suggest that this objective can be met under certain conditions.</data>

      <data key="title">referral embedded provision point mechanisms for crowdfunding of public projects</data>
      <data key="abstract">Civic Crowdfunding is emerging as a popular means to mobilize funding from citizens for public projects. A popular mechanism deployed on civic crowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total contributions must reach a predetermined threshold in order for the project to be provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria; unfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if it is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with refund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is higher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding effort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a public project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand the pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets funded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population. We call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point Mechanisms (REPPM). We specifically propose two variants of REPPM and both these mechanisms have the remarkable property that, at equilibrium, referral bonuses are offered but there is no need for actual payment of these bonuses. We establish that any given agent's equilibrium strategy is to refer other agents and to contribute in proportion to the agent's true value for the project. By referring others to contribute, an agent can, in fact, reduce his equilibrium contribution. In our view, the proposed mechanisms will lead to an increase in the number of projects that are funded on civic crowdfunding platforms.</data>

      <data key="title">tuning crowdsourced human computation</data>
      <data key="abstract">As the use of crowdsourcing increases, it is important to think about performance optimization. For this purpose, it is possible to think about each worker as a HPU(Human Processing Unit), and to draw inspiration from performance optimization on traditional computers or cloud nodes with CPUs. However, as we characterize HPUs in detail for this purpose, we find that there are important differences between CPUs and HPUs, leading to the need for completely new optimization algorithms. #R##N#In this paper, we study the specific optimization problem of obtaining results fastest for a crowd sourced job with a fixed total budget. In crowdsourcing, jobs are usually broken down into sets of small tasks, which are assigned to workers one at a time. We consider three scenarios of increasing complexity: Identical Round Homogeneous tasks, Multiplex Round Homogeneous tasks, and Multiple Round Heterogeneous tasks. For each scenario, we analyze the stochastic behavior of the HPU clock-rate as a function of the remuneration offered. After that, we develop an optimum Budget Allocation strategy to minimize the latency for job completion. We validate our results through extensive simulations and experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk.</data>

      <data key="title">fixed price diffusion mechanism design</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider a fixed-price mechanism design setting where a seller sells one item via a social network, but the seller can only directly communicate with her neighbours initially. Each other node in the network is a potential buyer with a valuation derived from a common distribution. With a standard fixed-price mechanism, the seller can only sell the item among her neighbours. To improve her revenue, she needs more buyers to join in the sale. To achieve this, we propose the very first fixed-price mechanism to incentivize the seller's neighbours to inform their neighbours about the sale and to eventually inform all buyers in the network to improve seller's revenue. Compared with the existing mechanisms for the same purpose, our mechanism does not require the buyers to reveal their valuations and it is computationally easy. More importantly, it guarantees that the improved revenue is at least 1/2 of the optimal.</data>

      <data key="title">quantifying surveillance in the networked age node based intrusions and group privacy</data>
      <data key="abstract">From the "right to be left alone" to the "right to selective disclosure", privacy has long been thought as the control individuals have over the information they share and reveal about themselves. However, in a world that is more connected than ever, the choices of the people we interact with increasingly affect our privacy. This forces us to rethink our definition of privacy. We here formalize and study, as local and global node- and edge-observability, Bloustein's concept of group privacy. We prove edge-observability to be independent of the graph structure, while node-observability depends only on the degree distribution of the graph. We show on synthetic datasets that, for attacks spanning several hops such as those implemented by social networks and current US laws, the presence of hubs increases node-observability while a high clustering coefficient decreases it, at fixed density. We then study the edge-observability of a large real-world mobile phone dataset over a month and show that, even under the restricted two-hops rule, compromising as little as 1% of the nodes leads to observing up to 46% of all communications in the network. More worrisome, we also show that on average 36\% of each person's communications would be locally edge-observable under the same rule. Finally, we use real sensing data to show how people living in cities are vulnerable to distributed node-observability attacks. Using a smartphone app to compromise 1\% of the population, an attacker could monitor the location of more than half of London's population. Taken together, our results show that the current individual-centric approach to privacy and data protection does not encompass the realities of modern life. This makes us---as a society---vulnerable to large-scale surveillance attacks which we need to develop protections against.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The World Wide Web is commonly seen as a platform that can harness the collective abilities of large numbers of people to accomplish tasks with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and scale. To explore the Web’s ability for social mobilization, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) held the DARPA Network Challenge, in which competing teams were asked to locate 10 red weather balloons placed at locations around the continental United States. Using a recursive incentive mechanism that both spread information about the task and incentivized individuals to act, our team was able to find all 10 balloons in less than 9 hours, thus winning the Challenge. We analyzed the theoretical and practical properties of this mechanism and compared it with other approaches.</data>

      <data key="title">a survey of incentives and mechanism design for human computation systems</data>
      <data key="abstract">Human computation systems (HCSs) have been widely adopted in various domains. Their goal is to harness human intelligence to solve computational problems that are beyond the capability of modern computers. One of the most challenging problems in HCSs is how to incentivize a broad range of users to participate in the system and make high efforts. This article surveys the field of HCSs from the perspective of incentives and mechanism design. We first review state-of-the-art HCSs, focusing on how incentives are provided to users. We then use mechanism design to theoretically analyze different incentives. We survey the mechanisms derived from state-of-the-art HCSs as well as classic mechanisms that have been used in HCSs. Finally, we discuss eight promising research directions for designing incentives in HCSs.</data>

      <data key="abstract">The tragedy of the digital commons does not prevent the copious voluntary production of content that one witnesses in the web. We show through an analysis of a massive data set from \texttt{YouTube} that the productivity exhibited in crowdsourcing exhibits a strong positive dependence on attention, measured by the number of downloads. Conversely, a lack of attention leads to a decrease in the number of videos uploaded and the consequent drop in productivity, which in many cases asymptotes to no uploads whatsoever. Moreover, uploaders compare themselves to others when having low productivity and to themselves when exceeding a threshold.</data>

      <data key="title">boomerang rebounding the consequences of reputation feedback on crowdsourcing platforms</data>
      <data key="abstract">Paid crowdsourcing platforms suffer from low-quality work and unfair rejections, but paradoxically, most workers and requesters have high reputation scores. These inflated scores, which make high-quality work and workers difficult to find, stem from social pressure to avoid giving negative feedback. We introduce Boomerang, a reputation system for crowdsourcing platforms that elicits more accurate feedback by rebounding the consequences of feedback directly back onto the person who gave it. With Boomerang, requesters find that their highly-rated workers gain earliest access to their future tasks, and workers find tasks from their highly-rated requesters at the top of their task feed. Field experiments verify that Boomerang causes both workers and requesters to provide feedback that is more closely aligned with their private opinions. Inspired by a game-theoretic notion of incentive-compatibility, Boomerang opens opportunities for interaction design to incentivize honest reporting over strategic dishonesty.</data>

      <data key="title">multi winner contests for strategic diffusion in social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">Strategic diffusion encourages participants to take active roles in promoting stakeholders' agendas by rewarding successful referrals. As social media continues to transform the way people communicate, strategic diffusion has become a powerful tool for stakeholders to influence people's decisions or behaviors for desired objectives. Existing reward mechanisms for strategic diffusion are usually either vulnerable to false-name attacks or not individually rational for participants that have made successful referrals. Here, we introduce a novel multi-winner contests (MWC) mechanism for strategic diffusion in social networks. The MWC mechanism satisfies several desirable properties, including false-name-proofness, individual rationality, budget constraint, monotonicity, and subgraph constraint. Numerical experiments on four real-world social network datasets demonstrate that stakeholders can significantly boost participants' aggregated efforts with proper design of competitions. Our work sheds light on how to design manipulation-resistant mechanisms with appropriate contests.</data>

      <data key="title">reply supply efficient crowdsourcing when workers do more than answer questions</data>
      <data key="abstract">Crowdsourcing works by distributing many small tasks to large numbers of workers, yet the true potential of crowdsourcing lies in workers doing more than performing simple tasks-they can apply their experience and creativity to provide new and unexpected information to the crowdsourcer. One such case is when workers not only answer a crowdsourcer's questions but also contribute new questions for subsequent crowd analysis, leading to a growing set of questions. This growth creates an inherent bias for early questions since a question introduced earlier by a worker can be answered by more subsequent workers than a question introduced later. Here we study how to perform efficient crowdsourcing with such growing question sets. By modeling question sets as networks of interrelated questions, we introduce algorithms to help curtail the growth bias by efficiently distributing workers between exploring new questions and addressing current questions. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that these algorithms can efficiently explore an unbounded set of questions without losing confidence in crowd answers.</data>

      <data key="title">crowdsourcing data acquisition via social networks</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider a requester who acquires a set of data (e.g. images) that is not owned by one party. In order to collect all the data, crowdsourcing mechanisms have been widely used to seek help from the crowd. However, existing mechanisms rely on third-party platforms, and the workers from these platforms are not necessarily helpful and redundant data are also not properly handled. To combat this problem, we propose a novel crowdsourcing mechanism based on social networks, where the rewards of the workers are calculated by information entropy and a modified Shapley value. This mechanism incentivizes the workers from the network to not only provide all data they have, but also further invite their neighbours to offer more data. Eventually, the mechanism is able to acquire all data from all workers on the network with a constrained reward spending.</data>

      <data key="title">performance of social network sensors during hurricane sandy</data>
      <data key="abstract">Information flow during catastrophic events is a critical aspect of disaster management. Modern communication platforms, in particular online social networks, provide an opportunity to study such flow and derive early-warning sensors, thus improving emergency preparedness and response. Performance of the social networks sensor method, based on topological and behavioral properties derived from the “friendship paradox”, is studied here for over 50 million Twitter messages posted before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We find that differences in users’ network centrality effectively translate into moderate awareness advantage (up to 26 hours); and that geo-location of users within or outside of the hurricane-affected area plays a significant role in determining the scale of such an advantage. Emotional response appears to be universal regardless of the position in the network topology, and displays characteristic, easily detectable patterns, opening a possibility to implement a simple “sentiment sensing” technique that can detect and locate disasters.</data>

      <data key="title">towards a fair allocation of rewards in multi level marketing</data>
      <data key="abstract">An increasing number of businesses and organisations rely on existing users for finding new users or spreading a message. One of the widely used “refer-a-friend” mechanisms offers an equal reward to both the referrer and the invitee. This mechanism provides incentives for direct referrals and is fair to the invitee. On the other hand, multi-level marketing and recent social mobilisation experiments focus on mechanisms that incentivise both direct and indirect referrals. Such mechanisms share the reward for inviting a new member among the ancestors, usually in geometrically decreasing shares. A new member receives nothing at the time of joining. We study fairness in multi-level marketing mechanisms. We show how characteristic function games can be used to model referral marketing, show how the canonical fairness concept of the Shapley value can be applied to this setting, and establish the complexity of finding the Shapley value in each class, and provide a comparison of the Shapley value-based mechanism to existing referral mechanisms.</data>

      <data key="title">mechanism design for time critical and cost critical task execution via crowdsourcing</data>
      <data key="abstract">An exciting application of crowdsourcing is to use social networks in complex task execution. In this paper, we address the problem of a planner who needs to incentivize agents within a network in order to seek their help in executing an {\em atomic task} as well as in recruiting other agents to execute the task. We study this mechanism design problem under two natural resource optimization settings: (1) cost critical tasks, where the planner's goal is to minimize the total cost, and (2) time critical tasks, where the goal is to minimize the total time elapsed before the task is executed. We identify a set of desirable properties that should ideally be satisfied by a crowdsourcing mechanism. In particular, {\em sybil-proofness} and {\em collapse-proofness} are two complementary properties in our desiderata. We prove that no mechanism can satisfy all the desirable properties simultaneously. This leads us naturally to explore approximate versions of the critical properties. We focus our attention on approximate sybil-proofness and our exploration leads to a parametrized family of payment mechanisms which satisfy collapse-proofness. We characterize the approximate versions of the desirable properties in cost critical and time critical domain.</data>

      <data key="title">understanding information spreading in social media during hurricane sandy user activity and network properties</data>
      <data key="abstract">Many people use social media to seek information during disasters while lacking access to traditional information sources. In this study, we analyze Twitter data to understand information spreading activities of social media users during hurricane Sandy. We create multiple subgraphs of Twitter users based on activity levels and analyze network properties of the subgraphs. We observe that user information sharing activity follows a power-law distribution suggesting the existence of few highly active nodes in disseminating information and many other nodes being less active. We also observe close enough connected components and isolates at all levels of activity, and networks become less transitive, but more assortative for larger subgraphs. We also analyze the association between user activities and characteristics that may influence user behavior to spread information during a crisis. Users become more active in spreading information if they are centrally placed in the network, less eccentric, and have higher degrees. Our analysis provides insights on how to exploit user characteristics and network properties to spread information or limit the spreading of misinformation during a crisis event.</data>

      <data key="title">generalized lottery trees budget consistent incentive tree mechanisms for crowdsourcing</data>
      <data key="abstract">Incentive mechanism design has aroused extensive attention for crowdsourcing applications in recent years. Most research assumes that participants are already in the system and aware of the existence of crowdsourcing tasks. Whereas in real life scenarios without this assumption, it is a more effective way to leverage incentive tree mechanisms that incentivize both users' direct contributions and solicitations to other users. Although some such mechanisms have been investigated, we are the first to propose budget-consistent incentive tree mechanisms, called generalized lottrees, which require the total payout to all participants to be consistent with the announced budget, while guaranteeing several other desirable properties including continuing contribution incentive, continuing solicitation incentive, value proportional to contribution, unprofitable solicitor bypassing, and unprofitable sybil attack. Moreover, we present three types of generalized lottree mechanisms, 1-Pachira, K-Pachira, and Sharing-Pachira, which support more diversified requirements. A solid theoretical guidance to the mechanism selection is provided as well based on the Cumulative Prospect Theory. Both extensive simulations and realistic experiments with 82 users have been conducted to confirm our theoretical analysis.</data>

Furthermore, it enables a powerful and robust creative destruction process, which helps quickly filter out irrelevant knowledge. While still at an early stage, this mechanism design can not only bring insights for knowledge production organization design, but also has the potential to illuminate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the emergence of collective intelligence.</data>
