      <data key="abstract">We introduce the fastest known exact algorithm~for~the multiterminal cut problem with k terminals. In particular, we engineer existing as well as new data reduction rules. We use the rules within a branch-and-reduce framework and to boost the performance of an ILP formulation. Our algorithms achieve improvements in running time of up to multiple orders of magnitudes over the ILP formulation without data reductions, which has been the de facto standard used by practitioners. This allows us to solve instances to optimality that are significantly larger than was previously possible.</data>

      <data key="title">approximation algorithms for submodular multiway partition</data>
      <data key="abstract">We study algorithms for the Submodular Multiway Partition problem (SubMP). An instance of SubMP consists of a finite ground set $V$, a subset of $k$ elements $S = \{s_1,s_2,...,s_k\}$ called terminals, and a non-negative submodular set function $f:2^V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ on $V$ provided as a value oracle. The goal is to partition $V$ into $k$ sets $A_1,...,A_k$ such that for $1 \le i \le k$, $s_i \in A_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^k f(A_i)$ is minimized. SubMP generalizes some well-known problems such as the Multiway Cut problem in graphs and hypergraphs, and the Node-weighed Multiway Cut problem in graphs. SubMP for arbitrarysubmodular functions (instead of just symmetric functions) was considered by Zhao, Nagamochi and Ibaraki \cite{ZhaoNI05}. Previous algorithms were based on greedy splitting and divide and conquer strategies. In very recent work \cite{ChekuriE11} we proposed a convex-programming relaxation for SubMP based on the Lov\'asz-extension of a submodular function and showed its applicability for some special cases. In this paper we obtain the following results for arbitrary submodular functions via this relaxation. (i) A 2-approximation for SubMP. This improves the $(k-1)$-approximation from \cite{ZhaoNI05} and (ii) A $(1.5-1/k)$-approximation for SubMP when $f$ is symmetric. This improves the $2(1-1/k)$-approximation from \cite{Queyranne99,ZhaoNI05}.</data>

      <data key="abstract">We give a nearly linear time randomized approximation scheme for the Held-Karp bound [Held and Karp, 1970] for metric TSP. Formally, given an undirected edge-weighted graph $G$ on $m$ edges and $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the algorithm outputs in $O(m \log^4n /\epsilon^2)$ time, with high probability, a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the Held-Karp bound on the metric TSP instance induced by the shortest path metric on $G$. The algorithm can also be used to output a corresponding solution to the Subtour Elimination LP. We substantially improve upon the $O(m^2 \log^2(m)/\epsilon^2)$ running time achieved previously by Garg and Khandekar. The LP solution can be used to obtain a fast randomized $\big(\frac{3}{2} + \epsilon\big)$-approximation for metric TSP which improves upon the running time of previous implementations of Christofides' algorithm.</data>

      <data key="title">minimum k way cut of bounded size is fixed parameter tractable</data>
      <data key="abstract">We consider a the minimum k-way cut problem for unweighted graphs with a size bound s on the number of cut edges allowed. Thus we seek to remove as few edges as possible so as to split a graph into k components, or report that this requires cutting more than s edges. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in s. More precisely, for s=O(1), our algorithm runs in quadratic time while we have a different linear time algorithm for planar graphs and bounded genus graphs. Our tractability result stands in contrast to known W[1] hardness of related problems. Without the size bound, Downey et al.[2003] proved that the minimum k-way cut problem is W[1] hard in k even for simple unweighted graphs. Downey et al. asked about the status for planar graphs. Our result implies tractability in k for the planar graphs since the minimum k-way cut of a planar graph is of size at most 6k (more generally, we get tractability in k for any graph class with k-way cuts of size limited by is a function of k, e.g., bounded degree graphs, or simple graphs with an excluded minor). A simple reduction shows that vertex cuts are at least as hard as edge cuts, so the minimum k-way vertex cut is also W[1] hard in terms of k. Marx [2004] proved that finding a minimum k-way vertex cut of size s is also W[1] hard in s. Marx asked about the FPT status with edge cuts, which we prove tractable here. We are not aware of any other cut problem where the vertex version is W[1] hard but the edge version is FPT.</data>

Here we say that an edge is covered by $S$ iff at least one of its endpoints lies in $S$. #R##N#We present an FPT approximation scheme (FPT-AS) that runs in $(1/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$ time for the problem, which improves upon Gupta et al.'s $(k/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$-time FPT-AS [SODA'18, FOCS'18]. Our algorithm is simple: just use brute force to find the best $k$-vertex subset among the $O(k/\epsilon)$ vertices with maximum weighted degrees. #R##N#Our algorithm naturally yields an efficient approximate kernelization scheme of $O(k/\epsilon)$ vertices; previously, an $O(k^5/\epsilon^2)$-vertex approximate kernel is only known for the unweighted version of Max $k$-VC [Lokshtanov et al., STOC'17]. Interestingly, this has an application outside of parameterized complexity: using our approximate kernelization as a preprocessing step, we can directly apply Raghavendra and Tan's SDP-based algorithm for 2SAT with cardinality constraint [SODA'12] to give an $0.92$-approximation for Max $k$-VC in polynomial time. This improves upon Feige and Langberg's algorithm [J.

We provide an FPT-AS for Min $k$-VC with similar running time of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$, which again improves on a $(k/\epsilon)^{O(k)} poly(n)$-time FPT-AS of Gupta et al.

      <data key="title">the number of minimum k cuts improving the karger stein bound</data>
      <data key="abstract">Given an edge-weighted graph, how many minimum $k$-cuts can it have? This is a fundamental question in the intersection of algorithms, extremal combinatorics, and graph theory. It is particularly interesting in that the best known bounds are algorithmic: they stem from algorithms that compute the minimum $k$-cut. #R##N#In 1994, Karger and Stein obtained a randomized contraction algorithm that finds a minimum $k$-cut in $O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$ time. It can also enumerate all such $k$-cuts in the same running time, establishing a corresponding extremal bound of $O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$. Since then, the algorithmic side of the minimum $k$-cut problem has seen much progress, leading to a deterministic algorithm based on a tree packing result of Thorup, which enumerates all minimum $k$-cuts in the same asymptotic running time, and gives an alternate proof of the $O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$ bound. However, beating the Karger--Stein bound, even for computing a single minimum $k$-cut, has remained out of reach. #R##N#In this paper, we give an algorithm to enumerate all minimum $k$-cuts in $O(n^{(1.981+o(1))k})$ time, breaking the algorithmic and extremal barriers for enumerating minimum $k$-cuts. To obtain our result, we combine ideas from both the Karger--Stein and Thorup results, and draw a novel connection between minimum $k$-cut and extremal set theory. In particular, we give and use tighter bounds on the size of set systems with bounded dual VC-dimension, which may be of independent interest.</data>

Our weapons shall be two classical results known for decades: maximum volume minimum ( s , t ) -cuts by Ford and Fulkerson 11] and isolating cuts by Dahlhaus et al. 9]. We sharpen these old weapons with the help of submodular functions, and apply them to this problem, which enable us to design a more elaborated branching scheme on deciding whether a non-terminal vertex is with a terminal or not. This bounded search tree algorithm can be shown to run in 1.84 k ? n O ( 1 ) time, thereby breaking the 2 k ? n O ( 1 ) barrier. As a by-product, it gives a 1.36 k ? n O ( 1 ) time algorithm for 3-terminal cut. The preprocessing applied on non-terminal vertices might be of use for study of this problem from other aspects. The time complexity breaks the 2 k barrier.We use the classic tools that make the algorithm simpler.Disposal of non-terminal vertices shed light on kernelization.</data>

The minimum weight $k$-cut can be computed in $O(n^{O(k)})$ time, but when $k$ is treated as part of the input, computing the minimum weight $k$-cut is NP-Hard [Holdschmidt and Hochbaum 1994]. For $\operatorname{poly}(m,n,k)$-time algorithms, the best possible approximation factor is essentially 2 under the small set expansion hypothesis [Manurangsi 2017]. Saran and Vazirani [1995] showed that a $(2 - 2/k)$-approximately minimum weight $k$-cut can be computed by $O(k)$ minimum cuts, which implies an $\tilde{O}(mk)$ randomized running time via the nearly linear time randomized min-cut algorithm of Karger [2000]. Nagamochi and Kamidoi [2007] showed that the minimum weight $k$-cut can be computed deterministically in $O(mn + n^2 \log n)$ time. These results prompt two basic questions. The first concerns the role of randomization. Is there a deterministic algorithm for 2-approximate $k$-cuts matching the randomized running time of $\tilde{O}(mk)$? The second question qualitatively compares minimum cut to 2-approximate minimum $k$-cut.

This problem generalizes several graph cut problems, in particular the Multicut problem (the case p = 2), which is fixed-parameter tractable for the parameter k [Marx and Razgon, Bousquet et al., STOC 2011]. #R##N#We provide a dichotomy of the parameterized complexity of Steiner Multicut.
