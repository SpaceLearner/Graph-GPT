The clustering coefficient of C. S. Burrus is 0.5. This is calculated by counting the number of edges between the nodes connected to C. S. Burrus (in this case, there are three edges: C. S. Burrus-M. Lang, C. S. Burrus-H. Guo, and C. S. Burrus-D. Wei) and dividing it by the total number of possible edges between those nodes (in this case, six).
The clustering coefficient of M. Lang is 0.5. This is calculated by counting the number of edges between M. Lang's neighbors (C. S. Burrus, H. Guo, and D. Wei) and dividing it by the maximum number of edges possible between them (3).
0.5
0.75
The clustering coefficient of E. B. Fernandez is 0.4. This is calculated by counting the number of edges between the neighbors of E. B. Fernandez (Robert B. France, D. Wei, and James M. Bieman) and dividing that by the maximum number of edges that could exist between them (3).
0.2

Bieman, Behzad Bordbar, Cris Kobryn, Prabhakar M. Koushik, Steffen Zschaler, Philippe Collet, Stuart Kent, Frank Hernandez, Y. Raghu Reddy, C. Atkinson, Sean Thorpe, and D. Wei) and dividing it by the total number of possible edges between those neighbors (15).
The clustering coefficient of Prabhakar M. Koushik is 0.2. This is calculated by counting the number of connections between the neighbors of Prabhakar M. Koushik (Robert B. France, Jennifer Horkoff, Philippe Collet, Stuart Kent, Frank Hernandez, Y. Raghu Reddy, C. Atkinson, Sean Thorpe, and D. Wei) and dividing it by the total number of possible connections between those neighbors (36).
The clustering coefficient of Steffen Zschaler is 0.5. This is calculated by counting the number of edges between Steffen Zschaler's neighbors (Robert B. France, Philippe Collet, Stuart Kent, Frank Hernandez, Y. Raghu Reddy, C. Atkinson, Sean Thorpe, and D. Wei) and dividing it by the maximum number of edges that could exist between them (7).
The clustering coefficient of Philippe Collet is 0.5. This is calculated by counting the number of edges between Philippe Collet's neighbors (Robert B. France, Stuart Kent, Frank Hernandez, Y. Raghu Reddy, C. Atkinson, Sean Thorpe, and D. Wei) and dividing it by the total number of possible edges between them (7).
The clustering coefficient of Stuart Kent is 0.0, since he is not connected to any other nodes in the graph.
0.25
The clustering coefficient of Y. Raghu Reddy is 0.167. This is calculated by counting the number of connections between Y. Raghu Reddy's neighbors (Robert B. France, Philippe Collet, Stuart Kent, Frank Hernandez, C. Atkinson, Sean Thorpe, and D. Wei) and dividing by the maximum number of connections possible (6).
The clustering coefficient of C. Atkinson cannot be calculated from the given information. The clustering coefficient of a node is calculated by counting the number of edges between the node's neighbors and dividing it by the maximum number of edges that could possibly exist between them. Since the given information does not include the edges between C. Atkinson's neighbors, the clustering coefficient of C. Atkinson cannot be calculated.

The clustering coefficient of Juan Jiang is 0.67. This is calculated by counting the number of edges between his neighbors (3 edges) and dividing it by the total number of possible edges between his neighbors (6 edges).
The clustering coefficient of Robert A. Walker is 0.5. This is because Robert A. Walker has 4 neighbors (Yanping Wang, Jerry L. Potter, Xiao Luo, and K. Shiv) and 3 of them (Yanping Wang, Xiao Luo, and K. Shiv) are connected. Therefore, the clustering coefficient of Robert A. Walker is 3/4 = 0.5.
The clustering coefficient of Fanqi Meng is 0.0, since Fanqi Meng has no neighbors.
The clustering coefficient of Hongli Liu is 0.0. Hongli Liu has 4 neighbors (Yanping Wang, Xiao Luo, K. Shiv, and Yirong Wu), but none of them are connected to each other. Therefore, the clustering coefficient of Hongli Liu is 0.
The clustering coefficient of Feng Zhao is 0.0 since he has no neighbors.
The clustering coefficient of Yao Fu is 0.0, since he has no neighbors and thus no neighbors that are connected.
The clustering coefficient of Yanjiang Wang is 0.0 since he has only one neighbor (node 15) and they are not connected.
The clustering coefficient of Hui Yang is 0.5. This is because Hui Yang has two neighbors (Yanping Wang and Yanjiang Wang) and both of them are connected.

The clustering coefficient of Hans W. Nissen is 0.5. This is calculated by taking the number of connections between his direct neighbors (3) and dividing it by the maximum number of connections possible between his direct neighbors (6).
The clustering coefficient of Judy Goldsmith is 0.33.
The clustering coefficient of 3 is 0.5.
The clustering coefficient of D S Weld is 0.25.
